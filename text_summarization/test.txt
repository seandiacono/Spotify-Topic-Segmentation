like yeah so i've flown nine times on the affectionately known as the vomit comet
27:59
it's the parabolic flight and essentially it does what you'd want a plane never to do it pitches really
28:05
steeply upwards at 45 degrees that's a picture you yeah yeah that's test rate that's super early in my phd some of
28:11
just the passive tiles before we even put electronics in we were just testing the magnet polarity and the
28:18
essentially is it an energy favorable structure to self-assemble on its own so we tweaked a lot of things between are
28:23
we looking at a couple of them yeah you're looking at a bunch of them there's also almost 32 of them yeah
28:29
they're clumping they're clumping yeah can you comment on what's the difference between microgravity and and zero
28:35
gravity yes so there is it's important difference there is no zero gravity there's no nothing there's
28:42
in the universe there is no such thing as zero gravity so newton's law of gravity tells us that there's always
28:49
gravity attraction between any two objects so zero g is a shorthand that some of us fall into using or is a
28:54
little easier to communicate to the public the accurate term is microgravity where you are essentially floating
29:01
you're weightless but generally in free fall so on the parabolic flights the vomit comet you're in free fall at the end of
29:08
the parabola and in orbit around the earth when you're floating you're also in free fall
29:15
so affectionately call vomit comment i'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately so so what's it like
29:20
what's uh your first time to both philosophically spiritually and
29:26
biologically what's it like it's profound it is unlike anything else you will experience
29:34
on earth because it is this true feeling of weightlessness with no drag so the
29:40
closest experience you can think of would be floating in a pool but you move slowly when you float in a pool and your motion is restricted when you're
29:46
floating it's just you and your body flying like in a dream
29:52
it takes the littlest amount of energy like a finger tap against the wall of the plane to shoot all the way across
29:57
the fuselage wow and you can move at full speed like you're you can move your arms exactly your muscles there's no
30:04
yeah there's no resistance they actually tell you to make a memory
30:09
when you're on the plane because it's such a fleeting experience for your body that even a few days later you've already forgotten exactly what it
30:17
felt like it's so foreign to the human experience they kind of that you explicitly tried to really form this
30:23
into a membrane and then you could do the replay cognitively freeze it yeah
30:29
save right uh when we have neural link we can replay that um that memory so in terms of
30:36
how much stress it has on your body is it uh biologically stressful you do feel a 2g pull out right so the
30:43
cost of getting those micro g parabolas is you then have a 2g pull out and that's hard you have to
30:49
train for it uh if you move your neck too quickly in that 2g pull out you can strain muscles
30:54
but i wouldn't say that it's actually a a profound tough thing on the body it's really just
31:00
an incredibly novel experience and when you're in orbit and you're not having to go through the ups and downs
31:06
of the parabolic plane there's a real grace and elegance and you see the astronauts learn to operate in this
31:13
completely new environment what are some interesting differences between the parabolic plane and when you're actually going up in orbit is it
31:20
that with orbit you can look out and see yeah that blue little planet of ours you
31:26
can see the blue marble the stunning overview effect which is something i hope to see one day
31:31
um what's also really different is if you're in orbit for any significant period of time there's going to be a lot
31:36
more physiological changes to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight on the vomit comet everything from your
31:43
bones your muscles your eyeballs change shape uh there's a lot of different things that happen for long duration
31:50
space flight and we still have to as scientists we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges to be able to keep humans
31:56
thriving in microgravity or deep duration space missions deep duration space missions okay let's
32:04
talk about this um i'm just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions so approximately how long does
32:09
it take to travel to mars asking for a friend asking for a friend as we all do uh about three years for a round trip
