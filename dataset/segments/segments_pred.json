We've got two beautiful shirt designs inspired by our season on Flower Boy. So head to dissect podcast.com to check them out before they're gone. Okay. Thanks everyone. ",
        "Enjoy today's show from Spotify Studios. This is dissect long-form musical analysis broken into short digestible episodes. I'm your host cult crushed. \n\nTyler the Creator is 2017 album Flower Boy is a story of self-discovery and acceptance over the course of the album. ",
        "Tyler confronts his \n\nAll right ease anxiety loneliness and sexual identity in order to evolve as a person something he compares to a flower blooming from seeds. Tyler's Journey culminates with him expressing his feelings to a male love interest a moment made possible through Tyler's acceptance of his sexuality and is recognition of living in the moment. Tyler expresses. His feelings through the album's plan ultimate track glitter, which he attempts to leave on its crushes voicemail. \n\nThe irony of Flower Boys conclusion is that Tyler's voice mail doesn't actually go through we didn't get your message either because you were not sticking or because of a bad connection despite its Bittersweet conclusion. We recognize that flower boy was never really about Tyler's crush. It was about Tyler himself and all the demons. He had to confront to overcome his fears except himself and simply make the phone. \n\nIndeed flower boy isn't so much about finding love. But rather it's about Tyler putting himself in the position to love which as we know was no small feat but despite the importance of Tyler's journey to get to this point Flower Boys. Narrative does leave us wondering where the story goes from here with Tyler find love. Would he try again to connect with his Crush? If so, was that interest mutual and would Tyler continue the story on his next project? Well after nearly two years Tyler has returned. \n\nWith his follow-up to Flower Boy, and we finally get some answers to these questions. ",
        "Well kind of of course we're talking about Tyler the Creator's 2019 album the subject of today's special episode of dissect Igor. \n\nIgor was released on May 17th 2019 debuting at number one on the billboard 200 chart the opening moments of the album. ",
        "We just heard immediately make clear that Igor is not an attempt to replicate the sound and success of flower boy though. It contains no shortage of beautiful moment generally speaking Igor is aesthetically less polished than flower boy. It's a little rough around the edges. And while Tyler may have preferred a grittier aesthetic this time around his attention to detail and deliberate constructive of an overarching narrative. \n\nIs just as thought out as its predecessor Flower Boy case in point Igor's opening track is aptly titled Igor's theme Igor's theme for Shadows many of the thematic and Sonic motifs that will hear throughout the album. In fact, we can compare Igor's theme to something like an overture an overture is a brief piece of introductory Music performed before an opera. I kind of sophisticated version of a medley the Overture introduces many of the musical themes that will show up later in the Opera function. \n\nThis gets the audience's ears acclimated to what they're about to experience. So in those musical themes show up again later in the story. There's somewhat familiar to The Listener on Igor's theme Tyler puts a modern Twist on techniques typically utilized In classical overtures. Tyler introduces many of the sounds that will reoccur throughout the album a heavy distorted bass synthesizer sampled drums piano and brassy synthesizers. And while the majority of the song is instrumental the track does feature an array of diverse. \n\n",
        "Voices and the lyrics they perform actually for shadow lines at will reappear later in the album take for instance. The songs main refrain heard about 45 seconds into the track. The lyric here is riding around town. They gonna feel this one on the album's next track earthquake the hook contains a similar line about \n\nGoing around making the second main phrase that emerges from Igor's theme is a line. I got my eyes open, which is heard multiple times throughout the piece the line. I got my eyes open. \n\nHe appears on Igor's ninth track. What's good? We'll come to find out later this episode These two phrases ride around town. They gonna feel this one and I got my eyes open while have structural and thematic significance in the album's overarching narrative architecture. As Forbes as Chris Lambert point out in his piece on Igor quote the prominence and dominance of these two phrases on Igor's theme serves as a \n\nCause some of the album as a whole part one is an emotional Journey that you feel part two is about awareness seeing things for what they are and moving on unquote. But before we get too entrenched in the Alps narrative, I do quickly want to point out one last thing about Igor's theme the song begins with the distorted synthesizer playing a single note an E flat for 23 seconds. \n\nThis distorted bass synthesizer reappears all over Igor. In fact, it's featured in every single song on the album on tracks like new magic wand and what's good. It's the dominant instrument. \n\nBut this distorted bass synth also appears in songs where it doesn't entirely make sense or at least in places. You wouldn't typically expect take for instance the song Running Out of Time. The songs verses are filled with Lush vocal harmonies and an intimate electronic piano and yet there is a distorted bass synth stabbing away. \n\nDon't say don't say Tyler's decision to introduce the distorted sense. So dramatically in the album's opening moments coupled with his decision to feature the sound on every song on the album. ",
        "Well, it seems to be pretty intentional and thus warrant some consideration on one hand the distorted sent the something like a compositional adhesive a familiar recurring sound that helps stitch together Igor's diverse palette of musical styles influences and moods, but aside from this compositional function, \n\nAnd there's thematic implications as well again implied by the title Igor's theme it's not entirely out of the question that a distorted bass synth represents the character Igor himself similar to Sergei prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf an orchestral piece in which each instrument represents a different character in the story Igor's instrument might just be represented by this distorted synth something that comes into focus when we learn more about the character Igor himself and the journey he undergoes over the course of the album. \n\n",
        "And now is perhaps as good a time as any to briefly discuss the album's title and the character it implies Igor is an archetype character. He originated and is most associated with the Frankenstein film franchise Igor is a sidekick in manservant to the mad scientist Igor is a Lackey loyal to a fault and addresses the mad scientist as Master. He's typically grotesque and ugly often portrayed as a hunchback despite his loyalty the mad scientist. \n\nAs eager as a servant and dedicates his time and attention to Frankenstein his monster as we'll see Tyler purposefully draws on this Igor archetype and order to express his role in a relationship that is explored throughout the album beginning with the album second track earthquake. \n\n",
        "Stop shaking me up and taking my heartbreak. If Igor's theme was something like an overture the album second track earthquake is something like a thesis statement Tyler sings because you make my earthquake Ryan around your love is shaking me up and it's making my heart break this idea of up and down of emotional turbulence sets the stage for the narrative that will eventually unfold which is very much Tyler tottering between \n\nlove and despair infatuation and Malice devotion and frustration at the end of earthquake. We here Tyler in the background started counting sequence 1 2 3 this leads directly into the \n\nNext track I think which completes the four count four four four four with I think the central relationship explored in Igor slowly comes into Focus as expressed on the songs hook the overall impression we get from I think is one of infatuation of Tyler falling in love or so. He thinks \n\nthis hook as well. As I think's chord progression and overall musical environment is an interpolation of the 1982 song special lady by Nigeria musician BB maskel. \n\nDespite the hooks emphasis on Tyler's infatuation. ",
        "I thinks only verse contains several cues that begin revealing the complicating circumstances regarding this relationship. Wish you a call me because I'm sorry. This is not apology. You are such a distraction. That's what Tiana what the fuck is your \n\nIt and later says you're such a distraction fucking with t on and off. It would appear that Tyler's love interest isn't reciprocating his feelings in a manner. That is satisfactory something that comes into focus more when we extract meaning from a few subtle references Tyler hides in the verse. ",
        "The first of these Clues is found in the line, man. I wish you would call me by your name cuz I'm sorry this sites the 2017 film call me by your name which centers around two males Elio and Oliver getting \n\nRomantically involved during a summer in Northern Italy at the end of the film. ",
        "It's revealed that Oliver intends to marry a woman crushing Elio as will discover when we get deeper into Igor's narrative the plot of call me by your name will contain a number of parallels to Tyler Story the second clue planted it I think as found in the line you drive me cuckoo and I cough because I want you likely Anwar this references the song I Want You performed by Marvin Gaye but co-written by Lee Anwar \n\nI want you as all about unrequited love a one-sided love in the songs verse casings. I give you all the love. I want in return but half a Love Is All I feel and in the songs hook he sings I want you, but I want you to want me to I want you to want me just like I want you. \n\n",
        "Tyler's reference to this song seems a deliberate choice to express the Dynamics between he and his love interest a relationship that is one-sided where love is not reciprocated equally eager then progresses with the first of a handful of voice recordings featuring comedian and artist Jerrod Carmichael exactly what you run from you end up chasing like you can't avoid but just chasing it and just like try giving it everything that you can \n\nThere's always an obstacle drugs. We appearance throughout the album act as narrative threading helping to weave together the story into a cohesive whole withdraws first appearance. He says exactly what you run from you end up chasing similar to The up-and-down Motif introduced an earthquake this idea of running and chasing implies a dichotomy of back-and-forth of conflicting emotions indeed as we'll see Tyler will run from his love interest. One moment and chase him the next drugs quote end with the line. \n\nIs always an obstacle foreshadowing the obstacles Tyler will face when attempting to sort out the relationship in question. \n\nCleverly tying into drugs quote about running Tyler expresses one obstacle a faces, which is running out of time. Why time would be an issue is somewhat of a mystery until Tyler presents two more obstacles in the song second verse. \n\nThey say the costume. Tyler says take your mask off. I need her out the picture. Take your mask off. Stop lying to these n words. Stop lying to yourself. I know the real you Halloween eight for a minute lose the costume Tyler here presents a her and a mask that is love interest. Where's similar to the aforementioned film? Call me by your name. It seems that Tyler's love interests also has a woman in his life and that the mask he wears is a straight or \n\nOr heterosexual Persona, and so with Running Out of Time the love triangle Tyler is involved in comes into Focus. Tyler wants the guy the girl wants a guy and the guy wants. Well, it's not entirely clear what the guy wants yet, but Tyler doesn't plan on waiting around as he makes clear in the album's next track. Tyler is going to make the choice easy for him. Sometimes you gotta close the door to open a window. \n\nAt the beginning of new magic wand we hear the second appearance of Jerrod Carmichael. The expression close a door to open a window is typically one of consolation used to look on the bright side of a dark situation. It means something to the effect that when one opportunity end. It opens a possibility of a new opportunity as we soon find out on New magic wand Tyler's interpretation of the expression is much more Sinister he plans to slam the door shut. \n\nMarina in my bed, the songs first verse finds Tyler looking at a photo of his love interest with his girlfriend. Tyler's eyes are Green With Envy and he says I need to get her out the picture. She's really fucking up my frame. She's not developed. Like we are this leads into the songs hook like magic gone new magic wand Tyler here. \n\nIs playing off the magic wand tool used in the photo editing software Photoshop where one can select and remove objects from a picture Tyler of course wants this girl out of his love interest life, but as the song progresses this desire takes a dark turn pick a side. \n\nIf his love interest doesn't choose to leave his girl Tyler threatens to kill them both. It's here that we realized that new magic one is also a murder weapon a gun which leads into the album's next song A boy is a gun Tyler begins to recognize the danger he \n\nIn he Compares his love interest to a gun an object that protects as well as threatens the entire song embodies this dichotomy as Tyler says things like how can be the best for me? ",
        "I know you're the worst for me and later. He says don't leave stay right here. I want you right near you invited me to breakfast why the fuck your ex here Tyler's resentment grows stronger throughout the track culminating as a threatening command near the songs end. \n\n",
        "A boy is a guns production is based around samples taken from a 1971 song Bound by Ponderosa twins plus one. \n\nThis is the same song Kanye West samples in the final song of his album. Yeezus bound to see. \n\ntoday \n\nbut still look thirsty 21, but just fun fact the original unreleased version of Kanye's bound bound one was produced by Tyler the Creator and who would show up on Igor's next song puppet the track that follows the bound sampling a boy as a gun. Mr. ",
        "Kanye West \n\nConnie appears Midway through puppet a song that finds Tyler once again under the control of his love interest indeed despite. His best efforts to escape the relationship at the end of boy has a gun. Tyler is now comparing himself to a puppet and his love to a puppeteer. He'd literally can't control himself around this person. \n\nThis puppet relationship has been alluded to a number of times throughout the album. ",
        "We heard it as far back as song three. I think and in the hook of a boy is a gun Tyler claims. You got me by my neck. \n\nFor the first half of puppet Tyler reasserts the album long notion that he's being controlled by his love interest. He says things like I need your company. I want you to want for me. I can't maneuver without you next to me and later. He says what is your wish it can be granted but despite being pulled by strings near the end of the song second verse we hear signs of Tyler Breaking Free. He says, you're number one on my list. I am Santa whereas Rudolph Rudolph here is the girl in The Love Triangle. \n\nTriggering Tyler to say your parasitic Tyler then become self-aware saying I do not have self-control. I'm starting to wonder is this my free will or yours? This is followed by the song took which introduces the Kanye West Feature. We heard earlier Kane then adds a verse of his own a half spoken half sung passage that Fades over time. \n\nTaking three funnies presence on puppet seems metaphoric. He begins you lost son. And you've been trying to find your way to me. ",
        "It's possible Kanye here is playing some kind of father figure pushing Tyler to snap out of his lovers spell indeed puppets outro finds voices singing cut me loose, of course referring to cutting the puppet strings. Meanwhile Kane tells Tyler to quote breathe on a song and the context of the puppet Motif breathing. Here is a very \n\nhuman characteristic perhaps invoking the puppet Pinocchio's transformation into a real boy \n\nNo No Song but at some point you come to your senses punctuated by the Jerrod Carmichael quote we just heard the end of puppet is to me a critical juncture of Igor's narrative having teetered back and forth between infatuation and resentment between love and hostility Tyler finally cuts the strings and comes to his senses this shift is signaled by what's good a \n\nChange in musical mood and tone from the previous song puppet. \n\nMy lights off with the mic off. I don't get excited sniggers. I just get my mic what's good seems to be the purest expression of the eager character. The distorted sin that we speculated represents Igor dominates the entire track and Midway through the song Tyler actually named himself Igor directly. Lyrically. What's good is all Brash egotism and bravado. \n\nThe threads of Kanye West's continue here to as the songs hook evokes two tracks from Kanye's album Yeezus. I'm tearing you down. This interpolates lines from Kanye's New Slaves. I'm about to tear shit. Damn. I'm about to ask you out now. \n\nThe fuck they gonna say now directly following this New Slaves interpolation. Tyler says quote hard to believe in God when there's no mirrors around this seems to evoke the song. I am a god also from the Yeezus album as Lambert points out and is Igor peace. Tyler seems to be using that your character and the same way Kanye used the Yeezus. \n\nBoth utilize extreme ego to alleviate the pain and inadequacy, they feel from failed relationships specific to Igor Tyler exemplifies his concept clearly on what's good as its the song in which he reclaims his free. Will they know snaps his dependency on his love interest and becomes autonomous his eyes are now open. Tyler sees the life. \n\nAt the top of the episode we observed how Igor's theme foreshadowed the album's two large Parts through its use of lyrical fragment the lyrical fragment that foreshadowed part 2 was got my eyes open the same lyric. We just heard featured on what's good indeed. What's good is to me the Crux between Parts one and two the bridge that divides Tyler's emotional struggles to win over his love interest and the emotional Journey. He'll undergo an attempt to move on. \n\nThis divide is all but confirmed by Gerard's appearance at the end of what's good? \n\nI don't know what's harder letting go or just being okay with this passage signals an emotional and tonal shift into Igor second half which will focus on acceptance and moving on will break down that second half in detail draw some final conclusions and examine the connection between Igor and Flower Boy right after the break today's episode of dissect is brought to you by mail chimp. \n\nMailChimp has a new original podcast called the jump hosted by Shirley Manson.

        "We reached Igor's emotional and tonal shift The Divide between the album's two large Parts. Whereas part 1 detailed Tyler struggle to win over his love interest part 2 will detail is process of letting this love interest go. We recognize this shift straightaway and Igor's 10th track the first track of part 2 gone gone. Thank you. \n\nWith gone gone. Thank you. Tyler reflects upon his relationship with this person recognizing the mistakes that he made and acknowledging that his love is God both that his love has left him for the woman and that Tyler's love for this person is gone. He displays here at maturity and objective analysis of the situation acknowledging that each of their lives as a different set of blueprints with different timelines and their sets of blueprints just \n\naniline this time around since the building got torn down because the units in it out of Bob's some new shit never down with at least you never lived in your truth. I'm just happy I lived in it, but I finally found peace. So peace. \n\nAt the end of this verse Tyler wraps you never lived in your truth. I'm just happy I lived in it, but I finally found peace. So peace its implied here that Tyler believes the real reason his love interest chose. The girl was because he wasn't ready to take the mask off to live in the truth of his real sexual identity before saying goodbye. Tyler shows gratitude for being able to live in that truth. If only temporarily this shift toward gratitude continues into the second half of the song, but first we hear the album, \n\nFinal appearance from drug Carmichael. I hate wasted potential that shit crushes your spirit. It really does it crushes you so much. \n\nThis idea of wasted potential what carry us through the album's end. Most specifically on Igor's final track would immediately follows. This quote is a song. Thank you. We're in Tyler continues to express his gratitude for the time. He and his love interest spent together at the same time Tyler reveals that quote. I never want to fall in love again. Despite the good times. He's had the wounds from the relationship are still fresh and like many of us after a breakup Tyler writes off love altogether. \n\nThank yous hook as an interpolation of Japanese singer-songwriter tetsuro. Yamashita's 1998 song Fragile. Thank you for you. \n\nOnly night again having established his acceptance of the end Tyler begins the process of moving on with Igor's penultimate track. ",
        "I don't love you anymore because well Tyler seems ready to move on. It becomes clear in the second verse that he doesn't exactly know how to do so \n\nSomething without a roadmap forward Tyler feels like you'll be stuck in limbo forever because he can't picture a life without this person. He can't live with the idea of waste of potential Tyler proposes a solution on Igor's final track. Are we still friends? \n\nTyler plays up the common idiom we can still be friends which typically one says when breaking up with someone. It's more of a formality than anything something you say in the moment to ease the pain of leaving someone you propose a reduction in the relationship not an altogether abandonment of it though, many of these proposed friendships failed to materialize because when it comes to love oftentimes It's All or Nothing. \n\nOf course Tyler flips this let's be friends idiom as typically it's the one who's leaving. Someone who suggest being friend not the one who's left. And while Tyler's intentions may sound pure that he really does just want to be friends. There are indications throughout the song then apply. He might still be holding Hope For A Chance At Romance later down the road. \n\nIn this last iteration of the chorus Tyler interjects between the line are we still friends saying this can't end and need someone to say hi. This is followed by the final moment of the song an outer that finds Tyler singing can't say. Goodbye. \n\nThese are the last words we hear on the album can't say goodbye. It's not quite the resolution. We expected given the progress Tyler has made over the course of the album's final three songs all signs pointed to Tyler letting go and accepting the end now in the final hour it seems as asking to be friends comes from a place of desperation, perhaps the wasted potential that crushes one Spirit was simply too much to bear. Ultimately. It appears Tyler would prefer to have \n\nSomething rather than nothing even if it means the cycle of him falling in love might begin again and with this in mind, let's have a listen to the album's final moments as there's something very interesting about the way Igor end. \n\n",
        "The final note we here on Igor is a sustained B-flat that rings out for approximately six seconds. This is significant tonally because the song itself is in the key of F major nine times out of ten a song and F major resolves or ends with an F. Major chord yet. Are we still friends end on a B-flat? This will make more sense. If you hear it. Here's the four chord progression used throughout the song. \n\nHaving heard this throughout the song. We had expect the song to end like this sounds complete, right? It sounds like a resolution like we be comfortable and satisfied with the song ending their that's because we're in the key signature of F major and we just ended \n\nit on an F major chord the home chord in this key signature. Again. This is the ending you adhere in the vast majority of songs and F major but that's not what happens at the end of Igor instead of resolving into an F. Like we expect we get this not really satisfying right? That's because we've added on a B flat which is not resolved properly in the key signature of F major. \n\n",
        "Jerr, their harmonic tension is never relieved and so it feels like we've been left hanging. It feels incomplete just as the song title itself is an unanswered question are we still friends by definition does not resolve. It doesn't resolve totally nor does it resolved narratively because in the end Tyler doesn't win over his love interest he's destined to be Igor. The archetype character that is loyal to a fault the grotesque sidekick and manservant to the mad scientist whose attention and affection is \n\nfocused on the monster who in this story is the woman much like Tyler's failed dream of a happy life with his love Igor and without resolution. \n\nBut there is just one more thing notice the instrument Tyler chooses here to use. The final moments of Igor is the same instrument with which the album began a solo distorted bass synthesizer Igor's instrument though. It's now softer more subdued and perhaps even docile. We think of how Tyler pleaded for his love interest to remain as friend to not abandon his life completely an act that could be viewed as coming from a place of weakness and this way it would make sense that a distorted Bass. \n\nSounds a little well week, but things take an extremely interesting turn when we consider the note with which the album began at the top of the episode. ",
        "I noted that Igor's theme begins with the sustained E flat. \n\nIgor's theme beginning with an E flat makes sense because the song itself is in the key signature of E flat minor and in every key signature, there's what's known as a dominant chord a dominant chord is a quart of tension and a given key signature its function is to provide the tension necessary for a satisfying resolution into a ketone chord. Once again, this will make more sense. If you hear it. Here's a chord progression in the key of E flat minor. \n\nDoes this sound complete no, right or hanging here on the key signatures dominant court that court of tension. Our ears really really want us to land on the home court which in this case is E flat minor, ah feel that that's a satisfying resolution made possible by the tension inherent in that dominant chord this \n\nuse of dominant chord is extremely common in all western music. ",
        "It's something you've heard thousands of times whether you know it or not. ",
        "So bringing this back to Igor's theme the song like we noted is in the key signature of E flat minor and the track itself begins with a sustained E-flat played on a distorted bass synthesizer. \n\nThe dominant chord in the key signature of E flat minor is a B-flat. That's the cord we heard create all that tension in our example B flat resolution in the E flat again in the key of E flat the dominant chord the chord of extreme tension as a B-flat now. ",
        "Do you remember the note are we still friends ends with the note that left us hanging that end of the song in the album as a whole on a lack of resolution. \n\nYou guessed it that note is a B-flat the final unresolved note that the album Igor ends on is actually resolved. When you begin the album again Igor the album and its story is a loop because what you run from is exactly what you end up chasing. \n\nThere's a number of somatic implications we can extract when we realize the connection between the albums beginning and end specifically we think of where we landed on the final song with Tyler asking his love if they can remain friends. ",
        "It seems implied but the cyclical nature of the album that if they remain friends if Tyler's able to keep this person in his life in some capacity the cycle will repeat the earthquake up and down the turbulent of emotion his falling in love his frustration with the woman the puppets. \n\nEggs, and the lack of free will all of that will repeat leading him to feel unsatisfied leading him to open his eyes and see the light leading him to cut the puppet strings only to realize he can't imagine living without this person in his life asking him to befriend which triggers the entire cycle over again, like I applied a moment ago. This gives new meaning to the phrase what you run from you end up chasing Tyler appears to be caught in the loop and each time through the cycle. He's doomed to his fate as a third wheel. \n\nHe'll forever running and forever chasing forever the grotesque sidekick forever Igor and we began today's episode with a short recap of Tyler's previous album Flower Boy, we heard how the album ends with Tyler expressing how she feels to a male love interest via a phone call only to find out that his message failed to go through \n\nWe acknowledge that while this ending is Bittersweet the real accomplishment. Was that Tyler even made the phone call in the first place as he had to overcome a lot of inner conflicts to make that call including coming to terms with his sexuality in short. Tyler had to learn to love himself in order to put himself in a position to love someone else and despite the beauty of this sentiment. ",
        "We still couldn't help but wonder if Tyler and his fantasy love interest would ever connect one day and whether that would be addressed on his next album. \n\nWhile the story of Igor isn't exactly a clear linear connection to Flower Boy, there's evidence that the two stories are related the closest thing we get to a direct connection as found in the song A Boy as a gun. We're in Tyler references Flower Boy directly. \n\nTyler says they be bringing us up like now and again give a fuck what they talking about. I see you as a 10 I'ma leave it at that I'ma leave us as friends because the irony is I don't want to see you. Again. Tyler here is defending his love interest to his friends who seem to recognize that this person is toying with Tyler's emotions the last line because the irony is I don't want to see you again makes direct reference to the song See You Again from Flower Boy. \n\nAs you remember see you again is a song of which Tyler first romantically introduced the love interest on flower boy. ",
        "He's Tyler's dream boy and it's assumed that this boy is the same person Tyler calls at the end of the album saying the irony is I don't want to see you again seems to imply that the love interest on Igor is the same love interest Tyler wrote see you again about \n\nout which is why it's ironic that Tyler doesn't want to see this person again, but there's a larger irony perhaps even tragedy that comes when we realize that the love interest on both Flower Boy and Igor are the same throughout Igor Tyler implies that the main reason he and his Crush are not together is this person's inability to live in his truth to take the mask off and fully commit to his attraction to the same sex. He hasn't yet undergone what we witness Tyler undergo on Flower Boy and so he chooses the girl because it's safer. \n\nHaving been there himself. It makes sense that Tyler shows empathy for his love interest toward the end of Igor acknowledging their different blueprint and that everyone is on their own time line when it comes to self discovery and self-acceptance. But while we recognize this larger irony in the stories of Flower Boy and Igor, we'd be remiss if we didn't also recognize the story Silver Lining because despite Tyler's heartache Despair and Desperation exhibited throughout Igor. We have to acknowledge the fact that Tyler got to experience love in the first \n\nFirst place he got to experience a shared truth with his person even if that truth that love was turbulent knowing how much Tyler wanted even a chance at love how lonely he truly was on Flower Boy experiencing love for the first time as a benchmark event in anyone's life. So is experiencing your first heartbreak and frankly isn't that part of the deal when it comes to love? ",
        "Anyway, most of us don't hit a home run in our first at-bat. It takes a series of experiences to \n\nThe intensity of loves power to understand its highs and lows enough to assimilate it into our life successfully and so in a way, there's Beauty in the fact that Tyler had his heart broken on Igor because at least he was in the position to have his heart broken rather than still confined inside the suffocating walls of his garden shed. He got to experience the earthquake that is love all of its highs and lows the full bouquet of emotions Only Love Can Inspire knowing Tyler's journey to get to this point. \n\nThe fact that experience heartbreak to me is rather beautiful. It calls to mind the famous words of poet Alfred Lord Tennyson quote. I hold it true. Whatever befall I feel it when I sorrow most Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. \n\n",

        "Hello and welcome to 404 podcast fan. I'm your host Owen gossamer. This episode is brought to you by agile plus devops con where you can discover the latest in agile and devops methods tools and Leadership practices will have more on that later for now. Let's jump into the episode Lisa Crispin is a testing Advocate at Mabel and an authority and agile testing. I recently sat down with Lisa at a conference in Washington DC and we talked about how testers can add value to \n\nElement teams the importance of exploratory testing in automated development pipelines and why agile isn't all about speed. \n\n",
        "Simplest way that I think pastors can add value and even if they're brand-new to testing is just to ask questions because we think I questions nobody else thinks that like I was in a meeting yesterday. It was kind of a Sprint kickoff and and you know, I was I'm not really on that team so I was kind of sad staying out of it, but then a couple times of sec. I just think that's the question I'd ask questions. There be The Silence of this. I know that's a that's a really good question. Well, we should figure that out the answer to that. \n\nAlso, it's just a perspective that all the developers don't necessarily have and then the other way is just by trying to transfer our testing skills. ",
        "So the other like one of the things I suggested at this meeting yesterday, it's like well, I kind of asked him I said do you do desk checking, you know, like if a developer is about to check in the code for a story and she thinks she's done. It's really great if she would maybe ask a tester another developer and just saying hey, let me walk this through this with you use my code here might as \n\nyes still maybe I'll testing and then you know, either you're going to discover something is not quite done yet or yeah, we're really confident about that. ",
        "And so if I go pair with a developer do that that helps them see how I think and how I test and how I explore and then they start to pick up those skills and then fall on pairing which I've done a lot but that's hard to get going with a team that's not used to it not set up for it. ",
        "So but those are those are couple really simple things and just asking questions. \n\nYou know one of my favorite exercises that I got from a be bangs or is just visualizing your pipeline it as a tester goes. Hey, what is are performing our deployment pipeline look like can you draw it for me or can you put it on cards and laid on the table for me and then start asking questions about it. You know, what is this test Suite do what do you learn from this one? And that just helps generate the discussions of people go. Oh, you know what we could bring those in parallel are all we don't really need this here. \n\nSo yeah. Yeah, I think those are some great strategies and I love the two things is the tester asking the developer questions also developer if you get that opportunity to sit down with them at their desk and ask them for the developer might have asked questions test of doing something. Oh, why are you doing? ",
        "All right, and then they can think through that and then use that the next time trying to build code like last time. I was talking to Lisa. She said that maybe we can import or she tried this so I have to consider that when I do this next time you think about manual testing \n\nPotentially in that process obviously with Agilent about the time move fast and we're trying to deliver valuable software in a timely manner are there opportunities still within an automated devops pipeline to still inject yourself with manual testing. There are a couple of different approaches to that and on my last team one of the things that we made a conscious effort to do was the testers paired with developers at least a couple days a week and also we did exploratory. \n\nTessie workshops to teach him how to do that in the they were charged with 10 doing exploratory testing themselves as a parent on everything that that on that team. They did exploratory testing on the story. So because we only had a couple testers for like 30 developers that doesn't scale. So we've taught them some basic skills right in Charters, you know, we had Elizabeth Anderson is touching your aesthetic. \n\nCheat sheet on all the workstations and we have out way. I should make our own little checklist that we put into the psych channel so that they could go through that and that was only effective in one of the reasons. It was a that they were Keen to learn this Mercury testing because a lot of developers mace, I think they are is that their boss said, okay, here are the levels of advancement for a developer here. And here's the level of exploratory testing skills you need at each of these levels. So that was part of their professional development. \n\nSo that really motivated him. You really need that management support because if the managers are like just write some code and get that feature out and not thinking about we're trying to do continuous delivery here. We need good quality code or this is not going to work. And so that really worked well for us and the other thing we did was you still need to do testing at the feature level. So we got all these little stories that make them a future we tested them at this granular level, but has everything work together. How does everything work with other systems? ",
        "So we wrote as for Kari \n\nCharters at the feature level those were in the backlog with all the other stories and then we use feature flagging or feature toggles with these featured models. And so we just kept the feature off in production until we had that may last for three passing finish. ",
        "So it's an asynchronous party Revival is no party pipeline, but but it's asynchronous and you could do that with security testing accessibility testing anything where you feel like you might automate some of it but you really need a person to get in there and do it around and make sure you feel \n\nEvident, right? Yeah, I think that's so important. I think that while I'm at it but some of these conferences I hear you know manual testing is dead or manual testing is going to go away with Automation. And the truth is you really do need. I've been hearing that since the early days when I first became to testers, so yeah, you really do need the manual that the human element of people going in there because the thing is that we can we can teach the automator tell the automation to do so many different things. But at the end of the day like it's not the same as having a human clicking through it and testing this or want to automate the \n\nIt can be automated which is all the really boring stuff that nobody wants to do manually and then you might do badly manually because you hate doing it. So you might just like, huh? I've got this checklist of all the things I could check and it's really hard to do number eight. I'm just going to skip it because I don't think we touch that huh. So yeah, you need some really automate those things. So do you have time to do that are really serious manual exploring and and security and all these things that are being becoming more and more important, right? And yeah when you get to automate the boring things where you really get an opportunity to \n\nTo flex your creative muscle in and think through more critically a lot of things. I think there's a lot of the reason testers get into testing. Yeah to go in and do the exploring and looking at trying to figure out how other people might use that soft weight. ",
        "And now we've got all these great tools that let us know. How are how are real customers really are using it so we could instrument our code and we can use tools like segment that or mixpanel that give you information about what are people doing, you know, are they reach clicking here? \n\nAnd and then you can look at your test coverage and say hmmm. This many users are using this page, but we only have this many automated tests that are checking that page or of this media searches. Should we automate more or should we maybe focus in more exploratory testing their you know, what do we need? And so have a lot more information from production can really help us with that because you know, we know we're never going to have time to test all the things but can we test the important things are valuable to our customers? \n\n",
        "That's right. It's focus on those. Yeah, of course. So because at the end of the day, those are the people that the software is for it is for the customer whether it be external or internal as we move. You know, I think that agile is maybe becoming a little bit more mainstream more people. I think I heard in a survey this morning at 71 percent of teens are using that methodology release claiming saying that it is but now devops is kind of coming along and people are starting to \n\nWe'd like the idea of continuous integration and Automation and whatnot as we move to a more Dev offer as team start to move to more devops cultured start their devops Journeys. What are some sticking point you see with with new teams new to that offer even team that are experienced in devops with the testing side of things what the hell is over sir? Step out of it the same thing that pops is built on top of agile. ",
        "And it's interesting that we've a guest blog post a couple weeks ago that I thought was really insightful teams that focus on agile. \n\nIt's they struggle and I think just can't seem to get ahold of it. He said focus on devops in the banjo because you have to do you have to do all these things to do continuous delivery and those turn out to be a lot of the agile values and practices that we use we have do that collaborative effort. I think one of the mistakes people you make with devops is because unfortunately is named devops and it doesn't include all the other things that may be there that they hire devops. \n\nHave a devops team. That's okay in terms of getting you going with learning how to do the infrastructure as code. I learning how to use all these awesome tools that we have set up a pipeline, but you can't just leave it the hands of a specialist it got to transfer that now it's just like we testers have to transfer our testing knowledge. And so we all need to be collaborating with everybody on the team transferring that knowledge. You know, there's there's it was just sit Johanna that recently had a post that maybe we don't need generalizing. \n\nProbably calling generalizing Specialists or specialize in general. Anyway, generalized. Gently. I had always must be all about having General us and say we don't need him anymore because we do have all these specialist says hey, I think we do need specialist in a lot of cases, but I still think everybody on the team should be trying to learn as much as they can because there's going to be a time where the specialist in the available and somebody else going to have to step up and also it gives with him thinking about before they even start building a new feature. It starts thinking about testability is \n\nThinking about operability instrumented code. For example, what can we do to make a testable to make sure it's testable and Productions make sure we can react the production failures really quickly. We need to think about all those things up front and build up quality in and and I think when we do that with devops, it's a gel as well. I'm sad that we have to use all these labels. I think it's just human nature. Of course. I had a conversation with get back in 2001 when we didn't have a job yet. Even we had extremely \n\nI'm programming which is awesome. But that's a terrible name and and I you know, I I took like you call it that and he said well I said I am I helping 10 years people just say this is this is a good way to do software development and that have a name for it. This is software development, but we just can't seem to quite get there because people are hurting and they're struggling and they want they want that Silver Bullet. So it has to have a name we give it a name and then people. \n\nPeople think it's going to be innocent people think oh, I'm adopting agile. We're going to be fast. ",
        "No at just not about speed. It is about delivering value frequently, but that's because we're delivering tea on currency value. That's what continuous delivery is about. ",
        "That's how you get to a job working with continuous delivery. You can only do your you're deploying twice a week or maybe every day or multiple times a day. Those are tiny changes which lowers our risk. \n\nBut we're not going faster. We're not coding any faster. We're not typing any faster. We're learning good ways to slice these features down so we can deliver small increments and the teams are able to learn the domain so that this is the main so that when the time comes this is what we want this feature, we can look at it and say well, what is the purpose? What do you what are your goals with this and then we can say you know, what we can do like 80% of what you want in half the time that \n\nIt would take us to do the whole thing. \n\nWe do this 80% I good enough and they always say yes that makes you look really fast, but you didn't go any faster. You just cut out all the stuff. They don't absolutely be right and as you build in those increments be able to build small small chunks and you be decided at the end of that process that we really do need for the customers really do want that extra 20% of us addict. Exactly. I'm sure nine times out of 10 to get to that point to like Yeah. ",
        "We actually never needed that any we want some new exciting feature write the exact and I think that's the beauty of Agilent devops, but that \n\nThe important thing obviously inside of all that is that you're delivering and you mentioned a few times quality software that includes making sure that that that it's tet well-tested that it that it meets the security standards that need to be met and yelling said that pops does not incorporate those tests and SEC words in there, but I think as we move forward hopefully people understand that devops really is dead test SEC Biz, whatever it was everybody. Yeah, and I think it's really just about opening up the communication Channel. I mean, I always have used the term \n\nopportunity everybody on the team. This is always half hour or so and that's it has that name works, but people equate it with coders or programmers three Engineers. So that makes it a little hard. But yeah, I love that because at the end of the day really everyone in every person that on the development team testing development what they're all developing software and they make their playing different roles. ",
        "And unfortunately, I think one of the things that happens that's dysfunctional when team say they're going to do devops is \n\nOkay, we're going to we're going to have our pipeline we're going to use the cloud. We're going to get our developers working together with our operations people to get this going they don't do anything for the pastors and they don't change the process for delivering features. Right? So they're still doing these big bang Bang's and there's and then they're like acted at you know, and they're like, but we're going to let you know we're going to release twice a week or every day and they look at the textures and say well hurry up get that tested, you know, so it just stresses people out. It's terrible. It's like that. \n\nIt's not what it's about. So, yeah, they really need to back up and that it's really hard to slice two slices features. Don't deliver Montgomery. Really, I mean, you know our team starting with that everybody does but once you do and once you start getting into that Kate is just let me know their release every day. \n\nSo or whenever you need to whatever you want, it's not a big deal. You're not stressing out like we used to I'm releasing all this is terrible now. I need five days off. So when you when you start to try to slice the story that she mentioned that they're often difficult to get through that initial process. There's some steps you can take to try to work through getting people away from like, oh we're going to deliver a hundred percent. ",
        "So let's deliver five percent in two weeks and work from there. ",
        "I personally like to use Frameworks and help us have those \n\nConversation. So one of the things I've used a lot is impact mapping which is something developed by goeco as it several years ago and it's pretty simple and it's kind of like it looks a lot like mind mapping site. ",
        "You have your goal. What are we trying to achieve with this feature once again through the business wasn't going for a customer here. Hopefully I can get some money whatever and then so that's the Y and then we think about probably gonna screw this up because I'm not looking at impact. \n\nAnd it right now who can help us deliver that future. \n\nDevops, if you re Katrina cookies book a practical guide to devops she's a big section in there and building relationships build a relationship with the operations people build relations developers with proud of people with whoever you need and we need to think about who are all the people we need to build those relationships with how can they help us how my bigot or way, you know, maybe the finest person over there doesn't want to support us and doesn't want to buy us the tools that we need or something and then how will they help us and support us now? ",
        "This is the next layer. \n\nAnd then finally, what are we going to deliver? What are they? What are they gonna do? What are we what's going to emerge from this and I've found that helps really once you do all the possibilities, then you realize oh, you know what this part here. That's worth probably the money is that's probably where the revenue is. Let's start here, you know, or maybe just this is all very difficult. But this one looks like a quick win. Let's try it. Let's try this for instance an \n\nOf it. So it just visual really helps you the other thing. I really really am a fan of is Jeff Pence story mapping. And so that's all about, you know, timeline your feet. How will people use your future. What will they be? First old? I do seconds, you know, and and then for each of those things then you can dig into the details and then you can start thinking okay. What's our minimum viable product or are detached garage cause of learning releases, we're doing an experiment and we want to learn and you're so how are we going to \n\nTo slice that up. And again, it's a visual you're doing on a table or the floor or wall and it's the most important thing is that generates this conversations and makes you realize oh, you know, we think about that part like something comes up that the product people or the marketing people read it they didn't even think that think about it at all. And now that they've thought about it. They want to go back and regroup so that can save you a lot of time and rework which nobody likes rework. We don't want to have this cycle time, right? ",
        "So those Frameworks hi, \n\nI think are really good. Just any kind of getting concrete examples from the business stakeholders of or from the customers or user research. Give us an example of how you want to stay and and use those to illustrate the business roles at the story level. I really like example mapping from that wind. We're like we have again a goal. We have business roles and freeze business role. We have concrete examples and those how badass right Dee \n\nA test specifications, right and this can turn into automated test that become regression tests later on. So I think all those things were were using, you know, using our body writing talking moving around drinking water those all help our brains function better. \n\nAnd you know, we need that communication. Most software bugs are some lack of communication somewhere along the line. Right? Right. So sometimes for some of the framers I like just anything that gets people moving around talking. Yeah, of course, we have a lot of distributed things now, so that makes it more challenging but we also have these really awesome tools. Yeah. I think that's a great point in using those tools kind of to your advantage when you are distributed and hopefully getting opportunities, maybe throughout the year to get together as a team, or you can have those true physical. \n\n",
        "Based on this conversation, right? Well, I think that that's obviously super all I love the idea of the story mapping the kind of drawing out it means being able to visually see this is what were this is what we're trying to create and yeah, I never thought of that or yeah, maybe this would be a cool idea and really being able to experiment and work through processes smaller smaller chunks of time. We can basically try new things out. I think that I love the the learning learning really is yeah. \n\nYeah, that was a real eye-opener for me. Yeah, for sure. I think because like you said it's all about experimenting and trying to figure out what is going to work best for the team. What's going to work best for the for the customer for the business man. If we're able to to release these smaller learning releases figure out what it is, you know retro that retro the process but also get feedback and figure out how we go to improve that for greater. These number two great. We're going to be able to deliver that value. So which one of the principles is we're delivering. \n\nValue to the yeah, and you're not delivering the software the customer wants you're not delivering the value to the yeah. Are you may discover? That's not even something they want. I mean how many times have you worked on a team where you got this feature out of the nobody used it? Oh my gosh. Why did we do that? \n\n",

So I'm sure most of you know what human library is, but for people who don't know this would be a podcast which would give you a brief understanding. \n\nThing about what human library is all about and how it is way different and unique than a normal user Library. ",
        "So guys, let me introduce you to our special guest today first one we have mr. Anurag with us. And we also have Miss Christy, please would you like to you know, go ahead and you know, tell us a little bit about yourself first. I am from Bangalore. \n\n",
        "I work as an NGO that works for intervention child sexual abuse. I am interested in tennis. I'm interested in Reading like playing video games. Okay logic games. I'm Trish tea, and I think I've always been motivated to do social work since childhood. ",
        "I was a part of making a difference then I \n\nIsaac then human library and I came to like I came to Bangalore five years ago. And I think we all started human Library together and also like I work at crowded as a community manager and it's a platform which helps a lot of people for fundraising for various calls. Okay? Okay. So what was your inspiration behind starting human Library? \n\nI think for me it was it just came out of nowhere because I was just looking for like I was that time. I was in Delhi and I was looking for like what all things are happening around and where I can be a part active participant to make a positive difference and that is where I came across human library page and I did my research and that is how I met the whole team and we could start over here. Okay. So human Library obviously is a big name right across the globe. \n\nWe have a lot of branches I've seen in every possibility every possible country. ",
        "So how did you get in touch with you know, somebody in the human library then then starting all together a whole branch in Bangalore. It's also how how was the first day? Who did you meet? How did it all happen? Did you choose your friends how without it? ",
        "So one of our teammates Rhea is the one who actually so to start a human Library you have to apply for a license because it's an operated concept the idea is copyrighted one. \n\nThis was taught in Denmark in 2000 by this person. Kobani Abigail and his team. So you have to apply for a license, which is what we are. Did she applied for the license since there was no human library in Bangalore. She applied for a license. ",
        "They got back or neck or back to her and gave her permission to start one in Bangalore. So India had about a few for I think for poison already and so she was the first to \n\nstart here in the in Bangalore and then she contacted the rest of us to build the team and take it forward from there. ",
        "So, how did you guys meet Rhea? So basically I will I wanted to start a human Library banglar other likely Pica is one more librarian over here. She also wanted to start human library banglar. But since like we all got connected through Facebook page that we are created and then we thought like we all have the same motivation same vision. So let's all you know, \n\nPull this thing together. Okay. And then how many how many guys do you have in your team in Bangalore team right. ",
        "Now, there are six of us one the one who actually started this here real she is Broad right now. But so there are five first here in Bangalore for the first four of the five have been from the beginning. We've added one more new member who was actually a book previously and we've added one city I left too. \n\nEurope we've added in as well. So now there are fibers in Bangla working. ",
        "Okay, and we have I think we have a lot of volunteers also around 25 30 volunteers who are very active and I think without where they like without their health, it would have been like very very difficult for us to pull off this such a big even yeah, every human every event requires 20 people running around without the volunteers. We won't get anywhere actually. So yeah. \n\nIt's a combination of all of her artwork suitable for people who don't know exactly right what exactly human library is how would you define it? How would you say it only meant of the people understand so it's like like in a regular Library you go ahead take a book of the bookshelf sit down on a table and start reading is basic principle. You come here you take a look at the descriptions. We have folder human books we \n\nYeah, the whatever the the person is going to talk about. Usually it is something about their own life something that they've experienced or something about their lifestyle. So so a person whom we call the reader the reader can come in and take a look at all the descriptions and pick whichever book human book. They want to read and then they sat down with that book and a bunch of other readers like themselves and the book narrates their story their experiences, so \n\nIt 30 to 45 minutes, you are reading that book by listening to that person stories and adding to it. We also helping bringing a positive framework to our society by you know, encouraging open conversations about all the topics, whether it's something which is some some things can be a Prejudice something some stereotypes. You can always you I mean you grow up with a few stereotypes for you. \n\nPrejudices certain mindset because of your upbringing because of your environment. So this is a place where we don't we don't go via on normal morale which exists in our society, but we encourage all sorts of things which are not discussed anywhere else. So we basically provide a place a platform for everyone from any part of life to come across to share their \n\nWoody and we expect our readers and we tell them to be open-minded to take something from here to challenge their own stereotypes or prejudices that they have had before coming here. Yeah, so that is the whole Moto. That is the basic theme of humility by a stronger engine to like right now the Moto is unjust someone because we're all so quick to judge someone based on their appearance or what they do right by so. \n\nIs a space where you come and like throw all that prejudice aside and listen to the person from their own point of view and try to put yourself in those shoes. ",
        "I mean, it could be cast it could be sexuality. It could be physical appearance of a person it could be their own personal choices in life. It could be anything but we are a space we are we're like we are open to all all sorts of discussion again. ",
        "And and how do somebody reach out to let's say somebody wants to become a book, right? \n\nSo how do they reach out to you? What's the process? \n\nSo we have our Facebook page one way to reach SSI Facebook page wherein we have reader registration. Sorry book registration forms where in you know like we have a form where we have all the important questions that we would want to ask our books. And we also want the books to go through the whole, you know, the form properly because then they have to talk about those things when they come over here and it is very important for us to \n\nOn this story. So one part 1 ways Facebook page second base like we have now we have a QR scan codes so they can just scan that particular code at the event and get the book form and then fill it. So basically one part one way is the book form. The second way is if there is a book who recommends some other book or there's a reader anybody who recommends that you know, so-and-so guys there in the store is really different. It's just powerful. \n\nSo we approach the person and then interview them and then take it ahead. So you have an interview process where you sit and listen to a person or how his presentation skills are maybe to how what what kind of impact he can have other people more than presentation skill and impact we just see like how comfortable they are, you know telling their story because a lot of times when you go through a lot of things in life, you become like maybe you're not that like, maybe you're not at a state mental state where you can tell you a story. \n\nSo for us it is very important to take care of those things also, like considering from our books point of view also, so we take care of that also and we listen to the whole story like you said. Yeah for the impact and everything as well. And then what exactly is your vision towards human Library, like where do you want to take this? I'm sure you guys started this when two years ago in Bangla. Yeah, right. And what's the growth being so far from day one till today? We're at how what's the \n\nThe transition being from when we began. We actually we had a very explosive with yeah. Okay, we didn't think a lot of people would turn up for first event. We expected like 50 60 people but like 280, come on. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So that was also part of the appeal of human Library you listening to people's stories because I you know me don't know so that shows how how it's in our nature. \n\nWe'll reach out to people like to understand people. So since then in the past two years, we've had multiple events multiple chapters in different kinds of scepters like the the usual general public ones. But you also have like at corporates. We have at college campuses. So our readers we have some very loyal readers who come often, but we also have a lot Moon you'll just keep looking. \n\nComing in and it's nice to know because you know later after the event. They either send us a message saying I am fulfilled. Thank you for organizing this it was really nice. I got learn more and all that and that is the point of human life is to not change the mindset by at least open up your mind to what the book is talking about more like spreading an awareness because as she said Rises to that we have a lot of stereotypes and kind of \n\nYou know, we all are aligned specially in India, I believe right that we all have fixed mindsets. You know, this is what yeah, exactly more like a box wearing if you have to do this you have to do that, right? So it's more like you guys petting a good message out there to people. I've been a part of you know, human Library I've been coming off. \n\nEvery event that you guys do write the books that you get every how often does this happen. We try to have one event every month though in past like we had a lot of challenges like since it's a non-profit correct, you know event so we don't take any money from our readers. We don't take any money from anywhere like and we don't pay our books also, so it's like non like free from any kind of transaction. ",
        "So it has been a challenge like this. \n\nI think before it was a challenge for us to have a proper when you have everything arranged for the books. Sometimes we had to provide them with Transportation costs or food. So it has been a challenge but now I think after two years we are sorted at a lot of levels now. We know a lot of people now we have people who are approaching us for providing venue and we don't have like we don't have dates. Yeah. Okay, so it's a good thing. It's a good thing and like considering today we \n\nHad a whole day event and still we could see like the football since morning since the first session till the last session. So I think it's really like these are the things that shows how good things are going good how successful any Winters how successfully it is happening. So I think yeah, I think we have came really far really really far not only as as as like how the event is going but also like personally also in this journey, I think we have grown \n\nNot we have learnt how to manage so many people together and that to being calm how to handle so many people and everything that's going on. So, yeah, I think it has been a commendable journey and the past two years the the reach it has had yeah close Bando because I know I have friends who've told me that they like in their offices. ",
        "Some people are discussing about human library and \n\nlike they had not told their friends that they had attended. It's nice because people are talking about a very interesting topic. So it's good to see that a lot of people are interested in this concept which only serves to to our cause that you know that people opening up to new topics be conservative or controversial topics of controversial groups of people that we have prejudices about so it's good to see that the the mind is poping up with that. So, do you have any specific target audience? \n\nIns, you know any specific people in your target? How does it work? No, we don't have a target audience because human library is all about inclusiveness the whole concept revolves around open conversation and inclusiveness. So in fact from now on I think we are trying to have multilingual books majorly in kannada and Hindi so that you know people whom we are missing out just because of the language barrier we would be able to cater them as well. So yeah, I think this is a learning and this is \n\nsomething that we want to go ahead with the only criteria Criterion we have right now is that anybody who comes in to read should be either 18 years old or a kebab? It's not like we believe is 17 and younger people shouldn't be reading but a lot of these top books talk about controversial topics are like stabbing those sexual taboos gender and sexuality or like different romantic relationship Styles so some \n\nParents might not be okay with the children learning about this Iraq at this age. So that's the only reason why we ask people to be either 18 or above because we don't want so I think we have had a you know, children, you know, who came without their parents and I really appreciate them because those like they are they are really there are parents who are looking at how the world is changing and making their children a part of the change rather than shutting them to again a box man. \n\nReady, so I think we can we are open to it, but just looking at the scenario in our country and a society. We just take care of like it is just a point which is mentioned over there. ",
        "But if parents and sisters then we allow children to be about you don't basically we don't want to get in any legal trouble. So coming back to your previous question, right like you guys, you know spending money out of your own pocket every single \n\ntime you guys do that, right? So not everybody, you know has that, you know God's or let's say everybody wants to know spend out from from their pockets. Have you had instances where somebody you know coming in and saying, you know, like I'll contribute to this cause so how as a has that ever happened. I think we have had incidences where people wanted to donate or make a contribution but as a human Library organization, we believe that you know, we don't want \n\nThis monetary transaction if somebody wants to help we encourage them to be a volunteer help us design a poster help us design a t-shirt in in some way help us handling the whole event. But yes, that's true that you know, it costs us a lot of times because we have to get done the posters and transportation food. ",
        "So many things are there but what keeps us going is the impact like when we see something happening like there is a book which we have now who was a reader \n\nin our first session and he was a reader and he was not able to tell talk about his problems talk about whatever was going with him in his life to anybody. But today after two years. He is a vivid read like book with us and like we have some so many readers sitting for him. ",
        "So when you see those changes happening when you see a reader crying after storing after hearing maybe sexually like story \n\nTo sexual harassment or child harassment when you when you when you see those changes happening then I think that is the biggest motivator for us, which doesn't let us take our steps back. Yeah, and for people who don't know, you know, how old you guys are. Can you just tell us you're young at 17? My certificate would say that I'm 26. Okay, and I'm 27, so pretty young for you guys, you know. \n\nYou spending out money from your own pocket, you know, yeah. Yeah, we just started. Yeah, exactly. ",
        "All of the teammates are also of the same in the same spot. ",
        "It is difficult for us to you know, because these events happen like every month, correct. So for every month, you know, even if you're putting some money out like every month it becomes like eventually it becomes a big, you know, Lord that you take care of but again the impact \n\nLike when we see the impact when we see what is happening how we are changing. We are happy even if you are, you know changing a single mindset or a single life and when we see those things happening, I think that is that the level of satisfaction that it gives is like much more than the than the you know, unhappiness you get out of spending 500. Yeah. I think that that is how it is. ",
        "What exactly do you guys have, you know some 20 when it comes to \n\nthe human Library event. What is what is something very special to you guys when I say the word human Library what comes to your mind something special I think would be the number of people who are coming in to read to understand other people and most of our books are about topics that the general population would not consider like there's the whole concept of authoring people right? You consider this \n\nPeople like that enabling labeling them as Iago like, oh I am. I am man. Yeah. I am normally they're abnormal. Yeah, but we see the number of people who come into our try to understand try to based bridge the gap, right? So I think that's one thing that's special about human liability because the openness that people have and we can see that very clearly when people come they are very open to understanding because they don't know about this there are times when \n\nwe've had so we have a lot of books who are gender and sexuality related and we have we've had like some people especially like some older folks who don't understand anything about homosexuality about being transgender and they are like ask us at the registration desk logo. ",
        "Does this mean we explain it to them and then they're like, okay then I will go listen to them and expect old old people to Nick be completely against. Yeah, but that's that's that's a special thing about him libraries. \n\nBecause it's a platform where you're allowed to go sit with them and talk a lot of people actually choose to do that. So it's great to see that. It's that special thing for me. I think for me having a place having a safe place for expressing everything and anything that you feel is a is the biggest accomplishment that we have got through human library and that we have given to people so even when I reader comes and \n\nListening to a story if they want to share something they share it. We have seen it multiple times. We have seen it happening like while in the story. They also start sharing their own bits of it and they also realize a lot of things after having the open conversation, which we're supporting. So I think just just making somebody like, you know, getting close to themselves and having a proper place for there for them to express \n\nSays I think yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense for me personally for me. Also. Another thing is that so often our books talk about topics that are very emotional very personal to personal and it connects with a lot of readers. Like we have a lot of books who talked about having been abused as a child and then we have readers who relate a lot to that and we've had instances like in the in a very first event as well we had \n\nAs someone who started crying leader who is like God who was overwhelmed and started crying the single story and at the end it is a moment where they've they've let out that emotion and they're going back a little light-hearted like little light doing that. They're not alone. Yeah, and they don't allow because that's a that's a wonderful thing you like there is someone who's openly talking about about something that I have gone through so that gives a lot of strength and another gives lot of validation. \n\nTio so, I think that's another special thing that um, Larry of those and then when it comes to obviously the you know, the way that you guys work as you mentioned legal, you don't want to get according to legal things. ",
        "And you know, I'm sure that you know, since we have books you guys normally have post books that have not of gender related topics sharks were related topics, right? So have you guys also, you know happened in the past something like that happened where in you got \n\nGot into a mass where somebody came in, you know trying to say this time sir. Sometimes what happens is C over here. You are challenging somebody's mentality somebody's mindset color. So of course like some things are bound to happen, but we have never had any big incident but we have had incidences in some corporate events where they like they want to hold, you know, host human library, but they don't want certain books. So then then the \n\nIdea of human Library dilutes up, correct. It makes no sense for us. Correct. So that is one part. We are still struggling and we are trying to you know, tell them that this is the whole idea you need to have inclusiveness. If you're not having books related to particular topics, then you are not like you are negating something so already before even having the event and these are all educated people. Yes. We have never came across such such problem at any \n\nCity Campus or a generally wind but to cooperate even sometimes it doesn't align with their corporate Vision, but I don't know what it actually means. If you are wanting to break this two types. I mean, every stereotype is a stereotype. You kind you can't be sitting there and categorizing those select right? And \n\nWhat about the challenges any any specific challenge have you had in the past that you guys know how to deal with but eventually came out more stronger as a team that you know made sure that you guys stand for and what are some challenges that you face when you started human life one thing was you know earlier. We didn't know like we didn't realize that we needed to add a trigger warnings later. We realize because sometimes what happens people, you know when they listen to us. \n\nSorry, sometimes they get carried away and then they start questioning the book itself for their choices. I mean, if you are there at a event hearing somebody the whole idea of being a reader is keeping your mind open and trying to understand the others other person's point, but sometimes people start questioning them in a very very weird way like asking a bisexual person. Maybe you will realize later that you know, whatever you are doing is wrong right now is a very wrong. \n\nLong narrative to go ahead with so those things we had. I think we have had those things. So now we have trigger warnings. So I think a lot of such cases are taken care of so we have electricity mentioned. There are a lot of people readers who come in and give their own vices of they don't take a therapy. Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen a therapist about this? Like, of course they've consider the possibility the point of human library is to unjust somewhere and not pass. \n\nJudgment for your opinions. Then the books are not coming here and opening themselves up being vulnerable and sharing their most personal personal moments with you for you to attack them with your opinions or ever your judgments, right it is they're doing this voluntarily with no Financial Financial expectations at all, you're doing this voluntarily so that they can they hope to create an impact on like share or like open up someone's mind to \n\nto know what's happening with them and people like that. What's happening around? Yeah, what's happening around them as well. So that's been a challenge. But so we we we asked our readers like a bit and they come vegetable you ask them. We tell them that you know, first of all, we tell them that you're not allowed to ask the books person like contact information or like can I add you on Facebook? Can I have your number and all that that we don't encourage correct? ",
        "It has happened in the past but \n\nit's believe it up to the book to decide if \n\nif the book wants to share the number because some people genuinely some videos genuinely want to talk to the book about something other will have to yeah, so we leave it up to the book but we Tell the readers not to ask these questions, but also the thing about passing judgment that's been a challenge. Yeah. We've got it under control so far. It's been all right, but it does happen once in a while. \n\nRoll to the biggest challenge. ",
        "I think earlier that they had was having been use and I think the harp has we has been like the other sweetest people it drum. ",
        "I think every time we asked Vikram for the Hub, he has never liked given a negative answer even when they were, you know, different events happening. He somehow, you know managed to make a place for us so that we could host it. So now things are really good. \n\nBut in the beginning, I think we had to struggle a lot for when you because you understand. We are not paying for the venue because not we are not taking any money. So this is whoever provides us a venue that is also on a voluntary basis. So yeah, but now I think we get you know, we every other day somebody or some other person will be like getting in touch with us asking for the availability and they're like, we'll be telling them like maybe for two next two months. We don't have any availability and then \n\nThen we'll consider it later. So it's very motivating. I think it's hey, what is nice to get to those? Yeah. I ain't having no options. Yeah. Yes. It's also nice to see that a lot of places are offering this piece. Yes for some for a project like this. Correct. Another challenge. ",
        "I think is books old setup is English-speaking books in the speaking readers. \n\n",
        "And we live in a country like India where there are so many languages, right? Yeah that people who don't speak English don't come to our events and that's something we're trying to bridge the gap that electricity mention. We are trying to get multilingual books kind of books and ebooks Tamil Telugu the most prominent languages in Bangalore at least so that's been a challenge because we have no idea how to go about it. We have had no idea, but we're making some progress. \n\nBecause of we have some regard of books. Okay. Now we have Canada in Hindi books as well. ",
        "So yeah, we are looking forward I think from next event or next to next event. We will be having multiple books. So from the day you started right where you expel you actually got 200 people now turned out for the event. So where exactly is a vision. Where do you see the next milestone for the human Library? Like you would have some Envision right these many people these many books. So we started off with the eight. \n\nLooks at the first event and we've generally kept to that number around 8:00 8:00 to 10:00 today at this event. We have 19 books totally. So what we are looking hoping for is having more and more books at the same event, which me would mean a lot more readers. So that's what we're looking for. The next the next Milestone we're looking at is having is being able to conduct an event where we have \n\nLot more readers that double the amount of videos and that would mean double the amount of sorry double the amount of books. So that that would mean double the amount of Vetoes. Yeah. So then as an Arab said that you know, we want to increase the number of books, so it's not only about the quantity but also about the diversification that we want to bring in because we already like we saw in the beginning we had eight books. ",
        "We thought I'd like it's like we have a lot of diverse books with with us. \n\nBut as we went ahead we saw like there were a lot of topics still there or for which we were not having books. So we brainstormed we reached out to many people many books, you know, many people who like we saw their story somewhere on a media article or we got to know them through some Facebook page. So we got in touch with them and we like now we have them as our books. ",
        "So I think there are more topics which we are thinking upon and \n\nWe want to have books on just to name a few maybe I could say somebody who is working in a as a sex worker. We want to have them because nobody talks about it. Nobody knows what happens somebody who's a transgender. We want to have a book on the topic because again, it's a taboo and nobody knows the challenge is that like nobody knows what happens to their life, but they can judge them without \n\nout knowing it. So we want to you know, just eliminate that mentality and for that I think we are working really hard. We are trying to find new people belonging to different areas like some activities activists who are working for environment. So yeah, we are we are looking for diversifying our bookshelf and that would I think definitely give us more readers and everything will follow accordingly. It's also known going forces because so many kinds of people \n\nWho are not included the normal mainstream Society, right? So we have to keep diversifying like the bookshelf and we'll keep going and be one more point if I can add I think arm arm vision is also to go to each and every corner of Bangalore and host a human Library event because since last two years, I think we have been to many places whether it's Malaysia ROM, whether it's HSR. \n\nWhoremonger or if you go to come on Ali or NG Road, like right sophina plaza where we are sitting here in Dahlonega, and I think we've been to a lot of locations but still there are many many locations which like from from those places maybe people didn't get our partially to be a reader or maybe that's very far. So they are not able to come up to wherever the event is happening. So we are definitely looking for a spaces in like \n\nHertz or places where we have not been there. Yeah. And since this podcast is all about growth. ",
        "I want to understand from your perspective. How how much do you think, you know being open to these kind of you know, learning experiences is important for people's success. I think it's very very very important because I remember myself in the first event and I being an organizer also, I remember myself, you know having certain \n\nHaving such a certain very very ingrained, you know things in my mind whether I didn't I didn't understand as a person I didn't understand what is dragged about. I didn't understand different types of sexuality. I didn't understand, you know, if somebody is hiv-positive than what could be the possible reason. I also had a very very singular mentality, but I think because of these events we have grown personally a lot and you know, like \n\nTo start understanding a person start looking from their point of view. ",
        "It is going to impact everything all the violence that is happening these days. I think the major contributor is the Prejudice that you're having your having Prejudice about the let people you'll you'll just try to fight with them. You're having Prejudice with the gay people or lgbtq Community. You will try to make a chaos fight, you know, pull them down. So once people start accepting these things I \n\nI think it is going to impact the whole society in a much better way. \n\nAccording to you in Iraq. What do you think how important you know people being open is for their success for the for the society success. I think for a society to succeed. It would involve bringing everybody on board because you can't have AB success having for having people in the background so and to have everybody on board you have to give everybody equal. \n\nHumility is about bridging that Gap getting giving a platform for those people who are otherwise pushed to the margins, right? Yeah, so it is bringing awareness to these people bring awareness to the kinds of people they are and to make to make them seem to make people understand that they are as known as normal as you yourself are. \n\nOur because what happens at human library is you come with these preconceived notions about these people, but when you sit down with them have like a an hour long Shadow for feminine chat you realize you have more similarities with these people than differences because otherwise you would see if I am assist gender person and I'm sitting with the transgender person. \n\n",
        "Even though we both humans, the first striking thing that is in your mind is that they're transgender and cisgender, but when you sit down with them, you see that okay, they both both I and this person who grew up in the same town. We same family. We had the same family custom. So you see you see the lot of similarities and differences. So I think bridging those gaps and making everybody including everybody in your \n\nUnderstanding of society in the understanding of people in society. I think that would translate into society succeeding in going forward. Also, you know, when these books come and then they share their story. So we have seen that seen the transformation happening in their own personality as well because earlier if they were not like maybe they were not even able to share this story with one person now, like they are sharing their Story to complete strangers career. \n\nI've seen a lot of books from here. They started from Human library. And now they are giving Ted Talks. Yeah, so like that's a huge achievement for us as a team. And every day I think we are adding new people new narratives to our group and it's really amazing to do be able to do that. Plus it also helps people write like a person who sharing it he's getting, you know his baggage, you know, let down plus people they are getting a different perspective. They're learning right? So it actually is a \n\nTrish but everybody who comes here at the event the more visibility these people who have been marginalized correct? The better the society understands them and the close of you all become. So yeah the point that in today's event. ",
        "Also I saw earlier a middle-aged anti sitting and listening to a person who has transformed from a guy to a girl and I could see the Expressions, but I could see \n\nSee that she was trying to understand and she didn't she didn't negate any point. She didn't, you know became you know, right wing at any point, but I think I think just to just to see these things. ",
        "It's it's like bringing a change into perspective. All right, any new projects that you guys are working on something something new that you guys are starting as human Library organization something else not you're already doing human Library band. \n\nIs there something else also that you guys are planning to know have a different thing start a different thing that can have more impact something like that. And you venture what are you plans or you're known as a group contributing towards the society or is it just making sure that human Library, you know expands more and more as of now is your focus only on human labor. If I think as a group are our focus is only human Library. We're in at as like personally we are doing different different things to help society and people in all the possible ways. \n\nWays but over here, we don't want to distract you do not want to distract. This is a huge thing that you're trying to make happen you that too in a country like India where people have problem with everything and anything beat religion Beat cast beat beat whatever be gender beat sexuality. So I think right now we don't want to get distracted not even a bit. We are just trying to make the framework better and better every day. Yeah this occupies a lot of our time. \n\nAnd yeah, you all have some other day jobs because this doesn't sustain us and organizing an event takes some trick some a lot of preparation like days of preparation so often we have our hands full so there isn't any time to let go for what we're looking at is just growing as a group reaching out to more and more people in the city. That's what our focus is on. ",
        "Okay, if I could ask you individually right one. \n\nPerson your own personal suggestion or let's say this is something that I ask every every, you know post or every person that I'm interviewing. If you could pass one message right could pass one message only to your kids. I know you guys are young yet. But let's say you are in your 60s and you you have a son or a daughter and there is one suggestion that you can give him or her. \n\n",
        "What would it be? \n\nI think for me it will be like \n\nFor me, it will be like listen to your heart and do everything that you want to do. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad. You will learn eventually life will teach you it has its own ways. But I mean just do whatever you want to do don't become Prejudice because of anything that's happening around that's happening in the society. Maybe tomorrow. I can be a person who can stop them from doing something. Maybe maybe I don't understand at that point. I don't understand the kind of choices that they make. \n\nI would tell them to still go ahead and make it because I think that is how I have lived my life, you know, so I think and and it will it has been a great journey. It has been it has taught me a lot of things. So I think with time life teaches you it's okay, but wherever you want to do, whatever you should just go ahead and do it cool for me. ",
        "I think the message I would want to pass on is that we have to make a \n\nI own my own judgments. I mean we are a humans are judgmental like judgment is inherent reform own judgment, but I think instead of letting what Society has views upon your certain kind of people I think and this is something I've learned personally is that when you interact with people with people whom you would have had negative ideas about when \n\nCheck with them you form your own judgments, you form your own opinion about them and often. It's very different from what Society has already created for that and I would I would tell that to my child like no form your own interact with them personal connection with the make a personal connection with them talk to them and then form your judgment then rely on someone else to give you that. Yeah, and lastly. ",
        "How can people reach out to a human LaBrie. How can they attend the events the most welcome on our Facebook page? \n\nDo like us you guys? Yeah, I mean if you guys like then you guys get the notification of our upcoming events. So it's not about the marketing like thing.

That's my favorite candy of all time. All right, every time I go to her house, I see sniggers. We got the check out. What about check out they get me? That's how the yummy give me another thing. \n\nTaco Bell, believe it or not. You love Taco Bell. And now you hate it. I was a big fan of Taco Bell, but after football practice everyday never going to sponsor us. Well, yeah, but it's not that I hate Taco Bell is just it doesn't mix well backtracking. Sorry. Sorry as much as I loved it when I was a kid trust me just doesn't agree with my stomach and everything else. So I just have one nothing agrees with your stomach. That's a problem. We'll get into that later. Okay, whatever you say. \n\nLet me see what else I see like having the night light on in my room and I hate it. Yeah, I like to make sure my room is pitch black as possible. Otherwise the guys sleep and all that money on the Philips Hue and you have set up to phone and every time I come up here it's a different color. You know, I like sitting the mood when I'm watching something. I'm getting in the zone with a video game or is a really good movie on the lighting everything that's important to me to recap you like to set the mood before you go to sleep. \n\nYeah, there's a timer actually believe it or not on the app that have for it. So if I fall asleep, I know we will be shut off when I wake up. \n\nI don't get you but go ahead and put in my not you might not get this one, but bear with me so when I was younger watching football having any idea who the teams were some reason I was very attracted to the Raiders and if you know me very very well, which this might be news to you. I was a really big Raider fan growing up. No, you tell me. Okay, so you must know how either way. \n\nWe went to the Super Bowl. I think it was what 2002 or 2001 this 2001 versus a bucks. Yeah, and they lost their husbands pretty heartbroken then because from then on come up until today. They've been terrible very terrible. Yeah, and my dad being a hardcore Cowboy fan. \n\nI kind of swung there. So you want against your grandpa your grandpa's the Raider fan. Yeah, so you loved the Raiders and I you hate them. Yeah, I hate them like so much more now. Do you have any like will carry on some more what you have but like you have any places besides Taco Bell Chuck E. Cheese this one I used to love Chuck E. Cheese Madam. Um, I think that's all I was on my mind to go ahead. \n\nI'm sure everybody loves Chuck E. ",
        "Cheese growing up getting those tokens clicking on the tickets. Obviously, it would be very awkward and weird. If I were to really enjoy Chuck-E-Cheese now, but even As I Grew Older and to my teams and for whatever reason still go to Chuck E cheese for like little kids birthday party. I used to hate it just because I was bigger than all the games there and the games are where the best did you think their pizza was amazing at the time? No. No, so you were one of those kids that knew they were eating shitty Pizza. Yeah because there is like that there's \n\nPlaces like dominoes Little Caesars the knew what they were doing all those pizzas you think of Caesars know what they were doing with the pizzas. Yeah, dude. Lucy's is delicious. $5 can't go wrong. If I think it's all in your head like I suppose but no it was something about the texture of the chicken cheese pizza that I just wasn't very fond of. Yeah. It was it was like they were trying to make flatbread but the dough would just end up being flat no matter what \n\nAnd the cheese didn't really taste like cheese. It tastes like microwavable Pizza. \n\nYeah, all right, what else? \n\nI like the ice cream man. \n\nBut but but not anymore not anymore. ",
        "Well only because I realized there's things such as grocery stores where I can get, you know more for my for my dollar. Yes support your local people trying to support their families it ice cream man. Who's going to charge me three dollars for one ice cream. ",
        "You can get where I can go. Yeah to like the liquor store or I can go to the liquor store or I can go to like Ralph's or a grocery store. ",
        "They can give me an ice cream a tub of ice cream. \n\nBag ice cream for just as much as one single ice cream from an ice cream man. ",
        "It's ridiculous. \n\nWhy would I do that? Yeah, but it's the experience. It's the it's the the happy faces. Yeah, what I was like 5 to 10 years old when I did have to worry about making money or what happens to your mind. When you hear the ding ding ding ding. Wow you hope the it's the allotted amount. Yeah, I'd rather it be the little man. I thought you were gonna say you don't like the ice cream man because because they don't carry around the what you call it the signs the gratings like the ABCD \n\nNo, I didn't really good care about that. \n\nI probably should have I find that hard to believe probably should have but I love all of us. What else man what you got. Let's see being messy. You hated being know you love being messy. ",
        "I love being messy because I don't have to worry about cleaning is that in my mom that did it but when my little sister stuff studying mixing it with my stuff and she started claiming my stuff to be her stuff. That's when I started to be a problem. Therefore I grew into \n\nA habit of making sure my stuff was completely separated and put away so she wouldn't claim my toys my things because you were the younger than me. So I made sure this from then on forward when we started to share a room in my little sister that my stuff was always clean put away where then she actually grew into being the messy one and I develop just all these clean habits like you're sitting on my bed right now and it's and it's made and it's impeccable. Everything is put in its place and that's just how I like my things. \n\nI can attest to that. \n\n",
        "Well, I think I've been up here while I 50 times and I think only once it was messy and to say messy was like an overstatement. I mean and over I understand it was not messy at all. But it was messy by your standards. ",
        "Yeah, would you say like you were like a \n\nWhen you love being messy like the Messier the better. \n\nIt's weird because I gave you the even if it was being messy, like I knew where all my shit was through the fact that I'm looking down and you have like both two pairs of shoes right here. You got some nice black boots on your red. Would you say Kurt got Kye Reese? Yes, the fact that they're both together and they're not crisscrossed and mixed like matched like you get it like you go into my room. You see like one pair of my Nikes right next to like another different brand and yours is everything is like exactly where it belongs. You. Got your \n\nYour Xbox room actually your Xbox four months out of place this I know yeah, I know but they're both on my bed because well actually I'm not entirely sure where both control. Oh, yeah, because I had to charge the batteries for one. The other one. I was using the actual like battery pack that I had for judging your room on the spot. Yeah. Anyways, great now you're pretty good you pretty what else loving now, he don't know. It's just beat me being weird, but something that I going back to like the kind of \n\nrelated to the candy and the sweets thing. I used to like opening the fridge and just be drinking. ",
        "No. No, I used to like drinking from the bottle also syrup. Oh, sir. Yeah like maple syrup like some Aunt Jemima Aunt Jemima. Where's the mop brand state of brother? Ralph's Kroger Brand syrup butter milk, none of that sugar free shit though. ",
        "Right? No full on full mm - just pop the top off like molasses just like it was a \n\nModel like you know, like a baby's bottle. I would just sit and just like like wasn't waterfall. You were like sucking on that shit. ",
        "Yep, God. Yeah and what how old are you I wanted this last. \n\nDamn that lasted it's really ugly personal shit. I did not expect it was like to lose. I got 11. You've reached a new low. Yeah, so you were 11 and now like if you were to see like a syrup bottle. I know I can handle and do it. But because just you feel like your teeth just rotting instantly us as you yeah. Yeah, don't get me wrong. I love so I love syrup on the pancakes or french toast things like that. But to just sit and drink syrup out of the bottle. \n\nNot anymore. Yeah not if I got him not about the how much how much money would you have to \n\nFor me to get you to do that. How much would you like 50 bucks hundred bucks? You gave me ten dollars. I would do it how much like announcer to or like the whole bottle. How much would you take a look at probably take every three hours to drink. I could probably take down the whole bottle and like a seating of 20 minutes 20 minutes. Yeah, ten bucks. Yeah. We're probably record that later for you guys. \n\nNow we're not going to do that. I don't want to have to do that. I could only imagine how long you're going to be in the bathroom. I like what makes like Peach weird because I didn't well growing up. I didn't really affect me much but doing that maybe now I might die probably. Yeah, what else what else you got fast food? You hate it. You love love me some passion man. McDonald's chicken nuggets. That was like my go to wherever they were chicken nuggets know what a Chick-fil-A every day. I don't know. I would say go everyday would say go pretty often but 130 Cal \n\nYes, 30 count nugget. I see dude. ",
        "It's a freaking bargain. What's what what's $15 a one-day like shove food in their mouth. Is it worth it down? And what is it of course scarf scarf it down. You just scarf that shit. Well, yeah, they're delicious and then knocks you out for hours like a baby. No. No, that's the that's the Jersey Mike's sub sandwich all Jersey Mike's. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what it is with that. It's just a very heavy sandwich shop. Yeah, that's a very heavy sandwich and every call 30 minutes later. I'm out. \n\nOut for the count. So would you consider Jersey Mike's fast food? \n\nNo, there's there's different. I think branches of what wouldn't I consider be fast food? Because I can cook in my fridge or whatever I cook whatever is in my fridge and make it fast make it fast and call it fast food and call fast food. But like I said, are you okay? Let's say drive-through fast food, right? Yeah. I was just gonna say it has a drive today. Yeah, that's to me like pretty fast. As you know, that stuff has been sitting there for quite some time and energy. All right, we got it was caveat to that because I used to work on a Carl's jr. That had no drive-through. So \n\nIf you walk up to it and be like this is a fast food. It's got him drive through. Yeah now just nitpicky, right? What else? What? Okay, what other place what fast food places? Can you not like right now like if you were to see it, you just like Del Taco. Well, you already mentioned Taco Bell's then that yeah, then there's Taco Bell. \n\nThat's about it. Like drive-through wise. I know I still did my McDonald's chicken nuggets, but I gotta eat it. Like as soon as I get it damn Delicious and their ketchup is delicious because it's very sweet ketchup or if I told you like all ketchup clean from like the same source. \n\nAnd everybody was just tricking you just because it has the name on it. I don't know. What else what else Heinz Ketchup is pretty bomb. ",
        "Aw. Dude. You recently told me what was that yesterday that you love Mexican ketchup got soup to I hate got to I don't know. Why you hate it. It's the my best thing that runny watery. I'm sorry to all my family that loves got to but I hate got to buy rather. Go to my next time. I got remind me when we go next year in the next couple of \n\nWhenever the hell we go to Mexico, we're I'm gonna smoke them on ketchup. \n\nThat I get allow you on that plane with that catches. Just catch it. It's yeah, it's still a liquid. It's still something that you can't bring in that carry on. What about in the bottom? I still think they're not going to allow you to bring it for some reason. All right, whatever don't give me that bad. I'd rather hear from them. I want to hear it from the government themselves. Go ahead. Right? What else you got? Well, this is one of my last things that because as a kid, I like doing a lot of stuff but a lot of it I still enjoy doing now. \n\nBut the one thing that I for whatever reason the soonest I would he get money like my dad would give me $5 and my mom would give me $10 feel like sweeping the floors or doing my chores or whatever. ",
        "I was very quick to spend it. There was a place around the corner from my house. It was called Papi chulos. \n\nNot entirely sure why it was called that strip club. No, but it was a liquor store liquor store. Was it even a I don't even know. ",
        "I don't even know if you call that a liquor store cause they didn't sell any liquor or is this this was in I want to say about flour on top each liquid Boulevard Papi chulos. If you're still there hit us up looking for a sponsor. They probably don't exist anymore. Yeah, but Mandy \n\nWe had lot of stuff to had like gummy worms. It had like ice cream at a hundred percent markup. Yeah probably know the gummy worms. He's actually be like, I think like five cents like a worm. Oh, this is way back. Yeah boy, they sold it by the worm sold to buy the worm. Ah, so now they have like a minimum like 15. So how much could you get for a dollar if it was five cents a worm? I was told there'd be no math. \n\n25 \n\nI'm honestly not entirely sure off the top of my head, but I think when he niggles 20 nickels make a dollar. All right, you work you were bawling with that just showing up with all these worms or you eat them right then and there probably I would probably toss him back as I was walking home. ",
        "But uh, yeah I do and then they had like, I don't know what it was but I always like to be prepared in school. So they had a bunch of cool school supplies that I used to like that pencil box is pencils pens colored pencils. \n\nWhen you were scholar, yeah, when I was a scholar as a good times, man, I used to love being prepared. But yeah, I would just soon as I get my money. I would spend it on just stuffed. It was entirely a useless either useless or very useful or just just because I was bored. I think I would do that too. ",
        "But and now you you hang on to your money, I do you don't you don't spend it excites me. You spend it but you'll spend you you are way more wise. \n\nWith it now. Yes. Yes. Yes. What else you got? ",
        "I mean that's pretty much all I have right now as far as I can remember first again. I am 26 years old and that was some time ago. It's funny. You mentioned Chuck-E-Cheese because for me number one well in no particular order, I loved Chuck E. Cheese loved it. Now every time I see it. It's like how does anybody consider that pizza and it's like the arcades were just okay the games were just wear it. So I'm saying like none of the game. \n\n",
        "Was cool. I think my mom told me one time when I was a kid the what is Chuck E cheese a rat. What is he? I'm no idea. What is a mouse mouse rat? Same thing. ",
        "That's right. He's a threat. He look like a rat like in his costume and stuff dude point is like Mom told me. I think that he came out from like but from like behind the curtains because like we sat in an area that look like a like a place where I got like a ballroom or something and it was curtains and here he comes coming out behind the curtains and like apparently scared the shit out of me. \n\nYeah, he's like this robotic mechanical god dude giant else. ",
        "So I but I loved I loved it after that after they read they told me that it was like all the shows whatever like I love going there now. Oh my God, I hate it. Like for some reason like there's soda tastes like medicine to me. I don't know why I did you hear God. I don't want to get in trouble. But my brother or somebody told me that some Chuck-E-Cheeses are being caught like recycling old pizza. I've actually maybe head \n\nI heard that too was it you little like they put like they make a whole pizza from other leftover pizzas. They probably saw it. Yeah. Oh God. I hope you imagine like they're like, okay, there's like three slices here. Let's just sprinkle some cheese on top to make it look like it's still connected as one piece. No. Yeah, because all right what else I used to love eggs with ketchup like scrambled eggs with ketchup. My mom will make me that for breakfast almost every day that I'm gonna give me crap for catch up, but you put ketchup on your eggs. \n\n",
        "Eggs, how old am I now this was back when I was a kid man. This is back in my Compton days when we lived in a tiny little house in the back house in Compton 127 Street Alameda. ",
        "My mom would make me eggs with ketchup almost every morning and I used to scarf it down now there I go saying do I'm going to use that word every day another scarf it down. What is this entire thing time that we're doing this? It's just we just keep saying scarf. \n\nProbably like way off. Yeah, let's just keep using scarf either way. So I would scarf it down almost every day. But now I hate it. ",
        "I can't I can't have my ketchup anywhere near my eggs. I used to love cars a lot. ",
        "I do I could be out on the street and you could be like the next hundred cars you see on the like drive by in the street tell me exactly what either make or model and or both. \n\nReady after this green light go under that kind of Civic on the court.

But as a kid, I was like in first grade and everybody would test me like we'd be out in PE and like, you know how like you can see some schools and you know, it's clear you can see onto the street every car. What was that accurate Toyota Honda what if you were wrong and you and you thought you knew those impossible? I was never wrong. Are you sure? I'm just sick. \n\n",

She's like, yeah. No, it's true used to do that all the time. So any thoughts on that disgusting that's terrible. Yeah your face when I \n\nhey Ty I enjoyed jelly. Jela are going back looks good. Yeah. No, I'm going on here. I'd love Jello, but not honest with you. I was a better guy as far as the jello powder. I didn't I wasn't very fond of Jell-O in general of that particular kind all this. The thing is it tasted nothing like jello. Oh, I'm sure it was just sweet sugarcane. ",
        "I'm sure and that that's what that's what bothered me when you said you messed with the jello powder. I was like, what did you do exactly do with it? You snort it. Did you look at you like where you going with that? I cut it up I got \n\nI gotta what do you what do you use a credit card it up or razor razor? Yeah and think that the know I don't know.

It's like okay, you're still good at least and that logic because I'm very fond of Cheetos up to this day. But plain Cheetos, but give me Hot Cheetos Cheetos don't have a cheese flavor. I hate that it says on the on the box I go cheesy snacks cheesy, whatever. I'm like all I taste is like a puffy thing that has an amazing tasting spice to it dealer. He no cheese. Do you add like your lime or lemon and a bag of Cheetos and external antenna? Yeah. \n\nI don't know that that is extremely spicy. Okay gum. I used to love gum. Not so much. ",

        "Let's just go for it. I think yeah, I think we should just go for it. Okay. Great fine. Okay. Hi. Welcome. This is the first episode of let's be realistic the podcast. I'm Nicole. My name is Patrick. Hello. It's checking us out. Yeah, this is our very first podcast ever. How do you feel? I feel pretty good. Well, okay, that's a lie. We've done many a test episodes and it's harder than I thought it would be actually it is. \n\nSo Props to the successful podcasters out there you guys definitely put in the work. Yeah even just editing after we muck everything up as hard and then thinking like, oh will be funny and then not at all funny. Oh and we found the only thing funny is the way we sound. Yeah, but that's what they tell you to expect. Right? Like when you hear your own voice played back. It just freaks you out and you hate it automatically know and I think that's part of it too. Then you go back through and listen to it and edit it and \n\nit's just your own annoying voice over and over again. Yeah, like wow, why are we even doing this is terrible? Yeah, I find myself wondering if people that like, I work with or or people at church or people anywhere really that I interact with our like saying that my voice is just so ridiculous know it's not your voice isn't ridiculous. It only sounds ridiculous to you. Perhaps truly. I promised I would tell you Joe and tell him where we are. \n\nWhat do you mean like why we're doing this and what's going on? Sure. ",
        "Well, okay first I think we wanted to do a podcast because we talk to each other about a lot of real life things. We're big on communication, but it's topics that we think could help and or apply to most people at definitely most people our age and we listen to a lot of podcasts ourselves. And so we were inspired by storytelling podcasts and podcast that talk about Mental Health \n\nAnd obviously True Crime but like the world doesn't need another True Crime podcast my start with swift my favorite murder as much as I don't want to give them credit for that because they don't need that. ",
        "It was that's how I fell in love with podcasts. And now the Honeydew by Ryan sickler is probably my favorite great podcast. If you haven't listened check out the Honeydew with Ryan sickler or if he's in one of your cities doing stand-up \n\nHe's really funny. Very down-to-earth. Just pretty much all around great guy. ",

        "No, I can't do it. I also like the history of the Great War. \n\nPodcast which is really good. It's a podcast about the history of world war one also very comprehensive sure really good. ",
        "I expect nothing less. I like the minimalist podcast and the Dave Ramsey podcast. Yeah, and honestly I support Dave Ramsey. Holy but I can't listen to him. Talk. You based me someone yeah, you can see the most of my podcasts that I listened to her. Very pragmatic very pragmatic and I go for more comedian. \n\nUm based podcasts. I also like the True Crime ones but there are only so many famous true crime stories that you can really talk about and you're not really passionate about that. So if we were going to tag team a podcast it couldn't be about that. Very true. ",
        "Oh and I feel like I should shout out the film crawl because I did a guest appearance on Friends Podcast salmon, Nicole host the film crawl. It's a great podcast reviewing movies, and I did a guest appearance on the \n\nThat I was like, oh, this is fun and like Granite. ",
        "I didn't do any of the editing or prep or anything. That's all Sam. So now I'm understanding how difficult it actually is, but just the Talking part was fun. So I think that's how we got here. It was definitely the Catalyst. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's definitely true. So shout out to them. They're doing an amazing job and just a quick little recap on some of the things that we're going to be doing. We're going to just have a we're going to be discussing topics or a realistic lines some fun things some \n\nIf things some things that might trigger you something actually some things that we hope will trigger you but not in like an offensive way just like hey, this is stuff that's happening in real life and we need to think about it rationally and hopefully we can present topics and that light dispel the myths. Yeah, remove the insta glamorous filters. Yeah. I think that's the goal for what we're doing here. So that said we thought our first episode should be about relationships because we're married. \n\nMarried to each other pom pom pom relationships and most people have been in or are currently in a relationship or want to be I think most of life revolves around trying to find someone that you want to hang out with forever. So we thought it's widely applicable and we have a little experience there at least. \n\nSo yeah relationships. I think at least for me. I really enjoy the podcast that incorporate storytelling. I think that's a more interesting way to talk about things. And so I thought that you and I could talk about not super in-depth our past relationships, but some of the things that maybe we were scarred from and then brought into this relationship with each other also known as baggage. Yeah, and then how we had to learn to overcome that and realize that not everyone is the same as your ex right? Very true. \n\n",
        "And for those who don't know us basically everybody who doesn't know us we have a good relationship. Yeah, we do Nicole and I like you I like you more. Oops. You don't know that you don't know that but we've had to work very hard at that. ",
        "It's not something that came easily and it's something that we continue to work on every day. But if and and if you work hard at that \n\nwe found that we like each other more. Oh, yeah, we've been married for five years and we like each other more. So that's that's really awesome. ",
        "Yeah, I think one of the first things for me, okay, so let me back up a little bit. I didn't really have any serious relationships. \n\nUntil really College I'd say I had one boyfriend in high school that didn't last very long because of me. \n\nhe's a great guy still talk to him sometimes but \n\nyou go to high school and you see everyone else dating people. You're like well, what's wrong with me? Why don't I have a boyfriend? \n\nAnd so then the first relationship for serious relationship I got into after that was in college and you think like oh, this is it. This is what it's supposed to be like right like you fall in love you have for serious relationship that lasts a long time you do everything together and you're like, oh this is what it's like, that's awesome. But then you know the longer you're with someone you see their true colors and you start to have issues, but that's the only relationship I ever had. So that started happening and that was the only frame \n\nI had to view relationships. So then when you and I started dating all I knew was that previous experience and so there were a lot of things I had to realize weren't going to be the same with you because you're a completely different person. \n\n",
        "Well, why don't you just tell the listeners what your your first issue what your first piece of baggage luggage? If your first luggage? What was what luggage did your suitcase? Did you bring a suitcase? ",
        "Oh several. Yes packed heavily heavily. Um, I remember one specific time. \n\nOkay. Now I have to back up again. So in with my ex there were a lot of times where it was clear that no matter what I needed or like if I needed help anything like that. It wasn't the priority for him. So I kind of just learned to do stuff myself and not ask for help because when I did it in a matter like I wasn't going to get help anyway, so I remember in in that relationship. ",
        "I was going to throw a bride. \n\nShower for my best friend Ashley shout I actually feel listening - and I had asked my boyfriend at the time if he would help with the setup because I'm throwing it basically by myself. Right? Like that's a lot of prep. It's a lot of cooking and baking and decorating and it should be right and he's like, oh, yeah for sure. I'll help you and then when the time came he didn't help at all. He was playing video games and I was like hey, but can you help he was like \n\nAnd that was basically the standard so then I know that I had to try really hard and would always kind of apologize when I would ask you for help. ",
        "Like hey, I'm so sorry, but can you help me do this? And you'd be like, yeah, like that's not a big deal. I don't understand why you're apologizing a little caveat guys if you can if you can find a girl. \n\n",
        "That has been through this similar issue. ",
        "It's the way to go because I'm telling you Nick whole like we redid our kitchen and Nicole put the entire backsplash up by herself. And I didn't do anything. Oh my gosh, that's not why? Yeah, I like start teaching how to swing a hammer. I'm for it. I'm all for it. But \n\nI had to learn that it's okay to ask for help and that it's all right to expect that. You're going to help me because we're a team and as long as I'm not doing something ridiculous like there's no reason you shouldn't want to help me and I can hold you accountable to that and that's okay. Like you can expect your partner to actually help you do things. You're not a burden just because you need help. Yeah, and I didn't understand why it was such an issue because I was brought up to help help build things help fix things. \n\nParticipate and I think that it's really important in a relationship to help your significant other. Yeah, it's not an it's I'm not speaking out of turn by saying that guys aren't really into bridal showers. It's not our thing. Sure. Most guys. Totally fair daughter wasn't asking him to stay for it. Right. But if you say you're going to help you should help. Yes precisely and that what you said about being raised to help is \n\nDefinitely part of it because I know that that wasn't his background but then just saying you're not gonna help me. Don't tell me you're going to help and then I think I'm going to be good to go on the day of and then not at all. Not at all. Help. What about you? What's something that you brought in to the relationship? Yeah, I brought in security and jealousy. Why who hurt you? Who hurt you? Why are you so lazy that you are? \n\nWhat gives you the right? ",
        "So I had former girlfriends that just weren't good and in what way? \n\nThey weren't committed and I could tell even though I told myself that that probably or tried to convince myself. Otherwise, I could tell that they weren't committed for the Long Haul and guys. It's okay if you want to if you want to be in a relationship, that's that's fine. That's healthy. What's not healthiest? \n\nTrying to convince yourself that your partner wants to be in a relationship when you know deep down they don't because what that causes is insecurity and jealousy, you know that I knew when they wanted to party. \n\nWith other people. Yeah without you not just exclusive right right that \n\nsomething was wrong. Yeah. \n\nThat wasn't always the case. I dated girls where I'm sure I caused insecurity and jealousy in them, but the ones that I was interested in. \n\nDefinitely did it to me until I found you the truth. So then how how did that translate into our relationship? Like what did I do? Anything that made you feel that same way or did you just have to like relearn that that's not always the case I had to relearn that that wasn't the case. I had to take a step back and assess the situation and know that that wasn't what was happening that you were trying to get out of this relationship that I wasn't. \n\nI wasn't I didn't need to protect myself for the inevitable you leaving well, and I didn't party so that probably helped that definitely helped. ",
        "Yeah, definitely helped well and that leads into another thing that I have seen a lot of recently which isn't our situation, but I know that there are lots of cases where people are dating and one person is super invested and one person is not super invested, but they don't say anything you have. \n\n",
        "Got to be up front about that kind of stuff like for you and your situation if someone would have said hey like it seems like you're way more into this than I am and I don't want to drag you along. How much would you appreciate it that like, hey great. Like that sucks. It's a horrible feeling but now I don't have to waste however many months of my life thinking that this is going somewhere when you know full well that it's not like that is so mean to let someone believe a relationship has a future when you know, it doesn't do that and don't kid yourself. \n\nYou know when somebody is not interested and you're only doing yourself a disservice by convincing yourself that they are interested hoping that they changed well and I would encourage those people to ask the hard questions. Even if you don't really want to know the answer you deserve the respect of the truth, you know, like say hey seems like maybe you're not into this is that the case give them the opportunity to tell you the truth make them be upfront about it and then you know what you can move on. \n\nYes, well, which brings me to my next issue even though I'm jumping ahead of you. My next issue is a commitment level. Yeah, I struggled with that because of insecurity and jealousy thinking that you weren't committed but for no for no better reason than you were moving you were going to go away for college for your last semester and thinking that \n\nYou wouldn't want to stay together through that time. Well, and that that wasn't the case. ",
        "However, our timing was weird. Like I had just broken up with the bad boyfriend that I was with her while I was going to go to Flagstaff and finish my degree in Flagstaff and I was gonna do whatever I wanted and date people and then you came along and then you messed up all of the player things and then I had to reorganize everything but it wasn't ever like oh I want \n\nBreak up as soon as I move. It was just like oh I need to rearrange my plans and I think I remember back when we have those conversations. I know I know where we were I can picture it in that Sprint the room next to my room upstairs. So my parents next. Yes, and I got off a late shift at work. I was having a rough day and then we had a conversation about staying together while you were at Flagstaff and \n\nIt's it freaked me out because I never thought for a second that I wanted to break up. But you were you were surprised that I didn't want to break up if I remember correctly. \n\nYeah, I think that sounds right but it wasn't like I was surprised and disappointed because I wanted to break up. It was just like oh like you're more committed to this than I think I anticipated right which was a great looking back was great timing because I literally got fired from my job the next day and had to rely on you for so much and it was just the worst time. ",
        "I think I'll be talked about it right there. We talked about commitment. Yeah, you you just got it. You really do you have to you have to ask the hard questions because \n\nImagine how horrible like hard of a question that was like hey, are we going to break up when you move in a couple months? \n\nOne right. That's an awkward conversation. Well, and what's worse you break up with somebody because you ask the hard question because you're a principled person and you ask the hard question. Hey, are you committed are you as committed as I am to this relationship and if the answer is no and you break up? Yeah, that sucks. But you know, it's going to suck a lot more when they leave or cheat on you or do something terrible or when you've wasted five years of your life when they knew from the beginning. It wasn't going anywhere right or when you rationalize. \n\nBeing bad decisions like having a kid or getting married when you know that this person is not as invested in the relationship as you are and that is very dangerous. Don't do that. Please listeners you have occurred conversations. ",
        "It's so much more worth it so much more worth it man. ",
        "The other thing that I know I brought into our relationship was just like feeling like someone was going to lose interest I think and \n\nI don't not that my ex ever lost interest in me, but it was always very clear that like he was going to do whatever he wanted and then you know, I would be there after kind of thing. Like I wasn't the priority. So I remember when you and I first started dating we talked all the time protects all the time talked on the phone. I don't think I've ever talked on the phone to anyone more than you probably besides maybe Kylie when we were in like kindergarten come in grade school. \n\nBecause my parents thought that we paid extra minutes on my cell phone to remember that maybe you call the house. I do I was yeah, I was in my 20s. It was like being in high school so good. Did they ever answer did you ever call and then one of my parents answered? I don't tell me no, I don't think so because we would start on the cell phone and then have to switch on this the mobile phone at all and unlimited. \n\nBecause what a throwback because it was you know in the 20 teens. Yeah, because it was like 2013 and that wasn't a thing anymore. Yeah bless her heart Susan, but anyway, so we would talk all the time, and we would hang out as much as possible. Our work schedules were different. So that was always a challenge and I was still in school. I was doing school college from home, but I remember one night you were supposed to come over and you had said that you were going to come over and I was doing my homework waiting for you to come over and then you just stopped replying to all my \n\nMessages so me being the person that's waiting for you to lose interest this whole time is like, oh it finally happened like this is it he's done. He's never gonna text my sweet wife thought that I ghosted her in week 2 of our relationship. That's good. And then I found out I don't know if it was the next day or several hours later what that you fell asleep and I was like, whatever. ",
        "Okay, like kind of perturbed but like glad that you weren't ghosting me and then \n\nMy next shift at Jimmy John's Hollow. That's where we met was a Jimmy John's we worked there together. My next shift I had to do inventory which is like a very involved process of counting tomatoes and heads of lettuce and like making sure yeah counting every single cup in the building think of inside of a Jimmy John's. You gotta count. Yeah counting the Mayo packets. ",
        "It's freaking male packets are it's lat well and you close it 10/10. So you're doing inventory till like midnight. It's a thing. It's \n\nIt's a burden and the next day after this he fell asleep and didn't come over thing. He showed up during my shift and said I'm sorry that I fell asleep. I am here to do inventory for you. So you can leave at a normal time and I was like, oh my gosh, this isn't at all the same as my last relationship. He's actually doing something that requires him to sacrifice his own time to show me that he's sorry and I was like, wow, this is way cooler than I think that's when I realized it wasn't going to be the same. \n\nThing. Yeah, I mean I want to help and I want that is who have it was another helping thing on top. Wow, he's hoping and he made me the priority double. Whammy no husband of the Year award goes to me know you really are a good husband. That's true. I try and hopefully I still surprise you. Okay, what else what else for you? \n\nI had substance issues. Yeah that's coming into our relationship. ",
        "Drugs drugs. Alcohol mainly drugs. ",
        "I would say tobacco cigarettes like a ad campaign. It's like a success campaign now. Yeah, but no you did have a lot of a lot of substances. Yes. I \n\nDidn't have a problem. I didn't have a problem stopping or starting drinking. I had a problem drinking too much and doing crazy things and stupid silly things like operating a motor vehicle. Yeah. ",
        "Now that that's not a good one. Not at all. And then I habitually smoked the marijuana and you know, not just habitually just like you were always \n\nI like the first what like a year and a half that I knew you I probably didn't see you not high probably so that was a real thing. Yeah. I had a philosophy that if you wanted to go to work High the best thing to do was to always be high right because that way they would never know something was weird, right? Because if you were just always high they know nothing to compare it to we're just and granted as bad as this is you did great. \n\n",
        "You got your stuff done. I don't know how but you did. \n\nI don't know how I did either but apparently it wasn't that good of a job because I got fired from a sandwich shop. ",
        "It was bad. That's true. That is true. \n\nBut substance abuse issues. That's something you brought in. But what do you mean by that? I mean that didn't ever really turn into an issue for us probably because we talked about it. We did we we kind of agreed that cigarettes had to go which I was fine with because I didn't get a lot out of them and it costs a ton of money. Yes. That was the one thing. I wanted you in the bathroom. Like I was not crazy about alcohol. I basically hated it at that point. \n\nIn my life and but you never made that an issue for us and the marijuana I wanted you to stop but I wasn't going to force you to do that. But the cigarettes I that's where I drew the line because that was actually killing you in real time. So that was the one thing I was like you gotta stop that. So with alcohol like I had previously mentioned that it wasn't a huge issue starting and stopping drinking, but you made a poor decision. I made poor decisions when I drink the whole thing everybody. \n\nHe does. ",
        "Yeah, but I think there are some people that are like that that have like a dependency dalco. ",
        "Sure none of that but it wasn't physical drink and I never I never had that problem. No, and so I stopped drinking as much because I stopped going to bars trying to meet women. Yeah. I met one and she was awesome. So that that helped a lot. And then with the marijuana I did not feel comfortable it. \n\nFull awkward when I was with you and I was high and you weren't or no, I wasn't it. Yeah, so it just felt weird and \n\nit also didn't feel the same because I didn't smoke cigarettes. \n\nSo it just kind of faded away faded away. ",
        "Yeah. \n\nSo that wasn't really like that. Well, I mean, I guess it was baggage that you brought in but it wasn't like something that harmed our relationship. You just kind of took care of it well and if that goes back to the commitment level, yeah, if you want to be in a relationship with somebody who doesn't have like the propensity to have substance issues or does it have fun doing drugs or something like that? You got you? Yeah, you got to make a choice. \n\nBecause I think worse than dragging somebody through relationship that you're not committed is dragging through dragging someone through a relationship that not only one are you not committed in but to you have a substance problem that is just the worst recipe for disaster recipe for disaster. And that is a hard conversation very awkward conversation that you need to have with yourself. Yeah, introspective. That's true. Yeah you I don't know you never really made any of that in issue. \n\nI think because you and I were friends for long enough before we started dating and this is true for me too that we both knew that if we dated that was probably going to be it several years ago. ",
        "We went to a New Year's Eve party. What we went to New Year's Eve party and we won't we won't name drop but what did New Year's Eve party and we were drinking if I was I don't think I was drinking barely anything are you talking about? Yes, I was drinking. ",
        "I was drinking a fair amount and we're having a really good time and \n\nAnd I went out back to smoke a cigar that I bought and there was a couple less than reputable gentlemen out there. Also smoking a cigar of a that wacky tabacky. That means marijuana. I'm trying to think they know that and I was like, no I got this i got this guy I used to do this whole time like no I got this little yeah. Hey, yeah, so let me \n\nWe you know what? I think I should tell their story on if she probably means it remembers it, right? Yeah sober, so it's after midnight. The ball has dropped. I'm not drunk, so I'm ready to go ready to get out of there because everyone that remains is drunk, and I'm not that's not a fun time. So we're making our rounds were saying by two people and I'm ready to go and the story of my life is that I'm ready to go and I'm like in the doorway. Meanwhile Patrick is talking to 764 people saying bye. \n\nTaking a very long time. So really I should have told him we were leaving an hour and a half ago. But anyway, we're trying to leave. I'm trying to leave and you're like, oh I'm going to say bye to the people out back and then you don't come back from that. You're just out back. And so I'm like, well, I guess I have to go out there after him. I had to take someone's jacket. Someone had to lend me their jacket so I could go retrieve you and as soon as I walked outside, I smelled it and I was like, oh no, there's marijuana out here. I \n\nfound you. I went over to the group of these gentlemen to which you referred. And you said hey, can I can I take a hit of this and what I'm in front of everyone what am I going to say? No, I'm going to be that wife in front of everyone and I was like, well, I mean, I guess like I don't really have a choice kind of pinned me in a corner here. So I said yeah go ahead my decisions. Yes. Yes poor decisions. So it takes a hit of this joint and almost immediately looks at me and says \n\nWe have to go now like yeah, I've been trying to leave for 30 minutes. I'm sure some people are aware of the term crossfaded this terrible. It's like it is the worst that you know immediately that you've got to go like this isn't a situation that sustainable any longer. No, it's no longer fun. And it's time to leave. It's time to leave before you just get in vomiting. Yeah so much poverty. ",
        "Well, not really because \n\nthen we were finally able to leave since now you wanted to leave so we get in the car and what we drive like two miles and you're like pull over pull over pull over and I'm thinking a lord like he's gonna throw up. Here we go. So I pulled over and he opens the door and just stares at the ground. It was back a couple of minutes and I'm like, okay. Well, how long are we gonna sit here? Because you're not throwing up. So then I start driving again couple miles down the road pull over pull over pull over. I'm like, oh my gosh. Okay. Are you like is this gonna happen this time? So I \n\nAll over nothing happens stares at the ground for a couple minutes. And so I'm like, okay we're going to keep driving and if you're going to throw up, you can throw about the window and then couple miles pull over pull over. I'm like, oh my gosh fine pull over nothing happens. He just stares at the ground. ",
        "I'm like, you know what we're not stopping any more if you're gonna throw up you're gonna throw up but we're gonna make it home because I can't do this not one of my finer moments know so we're just getting real deep into our lives it to her. \n\n",
        "Are so really the successes and failures. The moral of the story is that at the beginning of our relationship that wasn't an issue and then once really gives me repeat it was unwell and it wasn't it wasn't a regular issue and Year's Eve New Year's Eve pull out all the stops. It was a one-off. Yeah. I thought it was going to be just a very casual good time and then well it was until that happened. ",
        "Yeah, then the alcohol yeah makes you make bad decisions. Well, yeah, it makes you keep wanting to drink more alcohol and then someone and also trying you're like \n\nLooks like yeah, I know it's cool. I haven't I haven't done this for a couple of years, but I'm sure it's exactly the same. I'm sure my tolerance hasn't gone down at all fail. Yeah. Okay, what else? We're there any other issues any other baggage that you brought into our relationship and had to overcome? \n\nAnger, what do you mean? I think it's something that we're still overcoming but your I wouldn't say that you're an angry person. No, but I think that anger is something that a lot of people bring into a relationship not understanding how to deal with anger and how to make it work in the scope of a relationship. Yeah. It's really tricky if you want to be right then stay single, but if you want to be happy, you got to figure out how to deal with your anger. Yeah. \n\nNow that's very well said thank you. I think that recently we have learned that like a cool-off period is a great idea and I control and that's like that's normally advise that you get from people right? Like take Ten Walk Away take a walk take a shower before you continue to have an argument that it's basically wait 24 hours for you. Send that email. No. Yeah. That's yeah same thing save it in your drafts. Right? Don't do it. Yeah, don't do it. But yeah, I think that's something that has. \n\n",
        "Had to work really well for us is if we start to get heated take a break walk away. And then when you come back you carry like 20% about what you were talking about initially. Well, we learned early on. \n\nA cardinal rule of being married and getting into arguments eat something. Yeah when we were engaged and everything was super high stress and we started to get into an argument. The first question one of us would ask is when was the last time you ate and if it was longer than like a normal between meals period we would say, okay, we're not going to talk about this subject right now. We're going to go get something to eat. And then once your blood sugar is higher we can talk about it. ",
        "That's a real thing because such a real thing you do not have \n\nTo be Sigmund Freud to understand the eating food makes you happy makes you happy. You've seen those memes right where it's like my girlfriend before food and she's like scabbers. Yeah, and then after she's like dancing. Yeah eating an egg roll or something. It's it put it it's so true. Just eat something and that doesn't always work. But if it's a real issue that's not going to work, but it's not going to hurt. \n\nAlso understanding the underlying issues. Oh, yeah, I've really as of late been trying to identify the underlying issues if I've had a day like a bad day at work where I wasn't very productive or things should go my way people suck man. Yeah, and I realized that we're fighting over something stupid. Yeah something small like toilet seat or if you hear background noises of blinds and panting that's \n\nDog Greta, so I'm sorry we can't we don't want to lock her up during this but Brett has a German shepherd and she has a fantastic dog. Okay, let me just tell you let's not get on an entire tangent, but I just wanted to explain the background. Oh he's so what I found that that works for me when I when I can identify that the underlying issue is is something internal working out helps a lot. \n\nIt helps me, you know, just get the endorphins flowing and it it makes me care a lot less about things and that's exactly what you need when you're arguing with your significant other. Yes, you just need to not care because it's not again. It's not about you being right it's not about hey, I asked you to leave the toilet seat up and you just constantly do it or it's like not about being right. It's about being happy and compromise and it has to fit into every area of your life. Yeah well in leveling the playing field \n\nIf my blood sugar's low or I just feel like crap because I've just terrible day had a terrible day. I ate junk food and I just feel like a fat lard. Like that's that the cards are stacked against you. That's not the time to have a really heated deep conversation about real issues. Right? Yeah, you can definitely make the situation easier to handle eat something if you take away anything from this podcast. It's eat something before you have. \n\nArgument with your spouse damn like your significant other. Yeah that just for married people. Yeah, your parents your friends. That's true. Like if you if you were just in a bad mood, you haven't eaten what you know, what go make a sandwich seriously go make a sandwich sci-fi slap some slap. Some good-ass mayo on that sandwich and then try again. Yeah the try again true. Okay. ",
        "Um, well I last week put out a question. \n\nOn our Twitter and Instagram, which is a good time to shop those out. Great time. Our Instagram is let's be realistic pod and our Twitter is let's the letter B underscore realistic. So it's let's be realistic but there is an underscore instead of the e in be because the one I wanted was already taken. ",
        "I don't want to talk about it. But anyway, I put a question up about some of the worst issues that people have faced in relationships so that we could talk about them because maybe we've \n\nAce them or maybe we have some insight about it. So Nicole from the film crawl podcast that I talked about earlier put this go check the map. No, yeah, they're awesome. Definitely go check them out, but she put up some questions that I want to talk about. ",
        "So the first question she asked was what's the best way to get by different levels of profession? Like what if I worked at McDonald's and my boyfriend was a Hotshot CEO. She said that's purely an example because she doesn't work at McDonald's. It's not accurate but \n\nMy first thought was it sort of depends on the level of commitment in the relationship. ",
        "Like if you're just dating someone be honest about your profession on those first few dates, right? Like don't be ashamed of anything, but I don't think that that's going to be necessarily a deal-breaker right up front. If it's just like a casual first few dates kind of thing, but I do think it's something that you need to talk about and communicate about frequently because they're going to be a lot of different issues that you face just because of that disparity like hey, \n\nI am not going to be able to pay for myself at all of these super expensive restaurants that you can support on your CEO budget because I work at McDonald's. So can we talk about how we want to handle splitting bills or where we go things like that, but I think just communicating about it and being upfront is enough. I don't think you have to be ashamed about anything anything like that. Yeah, and I would say that if you like somebody you're gonna want to spend time with them and it doesn't matter what they do what their profession is if you like the \n\nPerson, right you're going to want to hang out with them more about personality than their. Yeah, and and I think that that helps you want to become better and want to seek better opportunities. But if you're happy doing what you're doing, like don't worry about it don't stress about it because the person that you want to be with or the person that wants to be with you rather, it's going to want to be with you regardless of what you're doing. \n\nBut I will say that be careful of that question because it sounds like an opportunity to try to convince yourself that you're not worthy of this that a you're not worthy or be to stay with somebody that is closer to here or is not committed. Yeah, true. ",
        "Also on the flip side if I'm the CEO what's more important to me is if this person who works at McDonald's or wherever is a \n\nVicious is or is complacent right? Like are they thinking this is where they're going to be for the rest of their life and they're fine with that or are they working towards something or it does this truly make them happy and they're an amazing person and it doesn't matter. Anyway, I think the person is far more important than the profession. Yeah and having having the hard conversations. Yes. Are you planning on working at McDonald's for the rest of your life, right? Is this your is this your goal? Is this the end game right and if they if the answer \n\nis yes. \n\n",
        "And that's a different that's a different conversation. If you're not okay with that, right? If you are then it doesn't matter well wrap and you have to know for yourself what you want. You need to have a good understanding of what you're looking for in a person as well because if that's a deal-breaker for you, then you don't even have to waste your time in those situations right? But if it's more about ambition or dreams and goals and aspirations, and maybe they're in school and maybe they're just trying to pay their \n\nYou know, like think different situations like that make the make the circumstance totally different. Yeah, and if you're saying to yourself, well, I really like this person but I don't like that. They don't have any ambition. I don't like that. They're only that they're just happy working at a lower level a job and I don't like their interest then it sounds like you don't like that person. Right? Right. Exactly. That's just one more thing on the cons list at that point. Yeah. Yes. \n\nBe be real with yourself. It's okay. If you like our if you met this like really hot chick and you're like, oh my gosh. Wow, she's great. Like we have a lot of fun together and then you find out like that she works but as a barista or something, oh cares who cares? \n\nIf it you take this relationship to the next level and that's something that bothers you once you put that out there if they're like no this is what I want to do if that's not okay with you then be honest right and say hey guess what? I really like you and you know, this has been really fun, but I want to be with somebody has career aspirations. That's a deal-breaker be cognizant of deal breakers. ",
        "And those are hard lines. Those are lines in the sand. Those are Hills, too. \n\n",
        "Ion like they will make him break your relationship. Yeah, absolutely. \n\nYeah, okay. So her next question was I need to know how y'all dudes view dating and the rules behind texting first / first date rules. So this sounds like it's going to be you. Let's hear what you have to say. Okay, let's start with how do you feel about girls texting first? I am all for it. Yeah. Do it done. You know what I texted you first to start our romantic relationship you did we were friends for a long time. But even if we weren't no it doesn't matter doesn't matter at all. \n\nWhat you said something to me a while ago that like guys love that absolutely like nothing makes your ego bigger than a girl hollering at you you because if I if I want to hang out with you, I don't want you to wait three days. ",
        "That's like that is the longest three days ever and that is just the least bit even that night even after a day or something like that or getting a number just like first in general. ",
        "Yeah, who cares what it is? Yeah, not like \n\nlisten ladies text text first, but but don't talk work. Look you want to throw up some red flags Texas guy 15 minutes after he drops you off and just let him know that you can still smell him. Like it's not like this man out do something crazy like that. But like that's our dog. But if the next day you're like, you know what screw it I'm going to text him just do it do it do it because you know what? ",
        "He's probably been staring at its phone all freaking morning like and he's probably been thinking the same. \n\n",
        "I think when do I text her? When do I texture and and if that's really a Miss if you text first and it doesn't go well, that's not the person for you. Anyway. Yep. It doesn't matter. If on find the next one. Yeah, if you are comfortable texting within 24 hours and they are put off by that. \n\nThen good thing. You only have 24 hours in. Yeah, absolutely by yeah, I don't find somebody else. There's always more out there. What about a girl asking you on a date? \n\nSame thing. Yeah, same thing. I'd agree with that. I am I'm very traditional but in that aspect, I'm very Progressive if there's no there's no reason that \n\nI have to I have to like beat the first one be the first one. Yeah, there there's no reason for that like guys still hold the door open pull your chair out like pull your dates chair out and continue that. \n\nWell into the relationship basically until you die, but there's nothing that says that a girl can't ask a guy out go for it. Yeah. No, I that's why I asked you out now. Yeah, that's different that can we go on a date? It's been for no. Yeah, that's true animal like we went to the grocery store the other day. What do you talk about today? I we have the free samples of the yogurt. \n\n",
        "Okay. What okay, let me give you a hypothetical situation. \n\nIf we weren't married doesn't even have to be me, but if you met someone, how long would you wait before you texted her asked someone if we met at like a bar or a sporting event? ",
        "Okay baseball game baseball game? ",
        "Sure, right we bumped into each other whilst getting corn dogs. I was gonna say hot dog and some of her ketchup got a mic or daughter some of my mustard. Come on herc. \n\nour dog then \n\nLook man, put a ring on it right then and there just get down on one knee. He's serious honestly 24 hours. Really? ",
        "Yeah to text the next day the next I think the next day is appropriate the next day just to send like Mike. What's up? ",
        "Yeah. Hey, how's it going? Hey, I really enjoyed talking to you the other day and I just wanted to see if you would want to grab a drink or grab dinner. Yeah. \n\nNo, I'm just I'm asking you right now. Do yes. I do. Yeah, I'd love to grab a drink or dinner. Can I take you to Chili's only cats? We have a gift card. Otherwise, I would a hundred percent say no to that as well as I would never ask. You know, you hate chili. ",
        "It's okay. Sorry chilies. Sorry chillers. Anyway, I think that covers that I have one question that I was thinking about full disclosure. I know the question. Yeah, but I still want to talk about it. Absolutely. ",
        "Okay can \n\nA man and a woman be legitimate best friends weight without actual sexual tension from at least one side. No, not at all because why because someone always likes the other person or would sleep with them giving the opportunity. It's just a bad idea. It's a bad idea unless one of the person it's a bad idea not accounting for sexuality like a gay guy can be best friends with the girl for sure. ",
        "Yes. Yeah, or \n\nOr the other way around but I just think that one if you're best friends if you're a guy and you're best friends with a female. \n\nJust date that just date that person right what else is missing there? Right because because this is the problem you run into your best friends with this person and then you find a person that you do want to date but they're not your best friend. So now you have two aspects of a perfect relationship in two different people. So now your best friend is one person and your romantic interest is one person when really ideally they would be the same person and why because like the only \n\nMario that comes into my mind is that the person that you're friends with isn't as attractive as a person that you want to date right? But but you do have as much genuine interest and sincere love for the person you're dating like you just think they're hot and on top of that if you're going on those premises premises sure Prem midnight premiere if you're going on that premise then the ultimate goal is just sucks anyways \n\nAnd I promise you sex with your significant other who is also your best friend is going to be way better way Wilder. Oops, like because it's going to be sustainable. You guys can get into some weird stuff after a while. You should marry that person. You should marry don't listen just just you should marry that person. Yes if your best friend is the opposite sex. You need to marry that person if truly your best friend is the opposite sex. You need to marry that person because sex doesn't last forever. \n\nLooks don't last forever. ",
        "But like that kind of relationship connection. That really goes a long way. I agree with that. I think that's great. ",
        "I think we're going to get some hate for that and I'm ready for it. Yeah. Hey, I we're gonna have some people are like, oh, I'm best friends with a guy and actually platonic. I don't believe you though, but ask yourself the question. So why are you with your boyfriend right or why are you with your significant other and if we're being honest is your boyfriend 100% okay. \n\nOkay with the fact that you're best friends with a man, right? And are you kind of placating this person right? Also, look, there's exceptions to every rule if you're the exception to the rule. Thank goodness. Yeah good on you. I'm not gonna I'm not going to engage in an argument if you like know it works and here are all the reasons why it works and yeah my best friend and my husband are are also best friends. This is for you. Yeah, great. ",
        "That doesn't have her very often. Yeah. No, it doesn't and \n\nSo good on you, but I would say that as a general rule. Yeah, this is generality. You cannot be friends. You should not have friends with the opposite sex. If you're in a committed relationship you I mean you can be like surface friends, but it's not going to be someone that you hang out with one-on-one probably. Yes. I'm not okay with my wife texting another man regularly, like that's just not that it's bad practice and I feel like it's just not okay, like it's going to it could potentially lead to \n\noh things and I'm not okay with that and vice versa on the other side of that on the flip side of that coin. I'm not going to text another woman regularly, right, but it's not my mom or my sister and I don't think some really sorry Mom. I love you I do. \n\nYeah. \n\nYeah, it would agree with that. Yeah, okay, you have any other questions not that are applicable in this episode. There will be others. So on that note our episodes won't always be on the same topic. So don't it won't always be about relationships. ",
        "We'd like to talk about issues that everybody faces things that come up budgeting on a day-to-day basis budgeting for sure guys. We're gonna get it. We're gonna start to we're gonna talk about sex. ",
        "I'm gonna throw on my my Barry White voice. \n\nIs no oh, oh, yeah. No. ",
        "Yeah, but we will it'll it'll get awkward and raw, but that's kind of what we want to do here. I'm going to share with you the secret guys for guys the secret for guys. No, no I have okay crazy wild sex tuned in. Yes, not on this oppressive. Yeah different episode. I would like to talk at least a little bit about politics not in a way that alienates people but just a realistic way. \n\nWay and honest truthful. These are the facts way. I'd like to talk about dogs and kids and all kinds of things just topics that everybody faces and we just want to keep it real truly. Absolutely. We're going to end we're going to have some shorter episodes where we talked about some perhaps like products that really work for us that we really truly believe in and some fun things to like travel and you know, \n\nOutdoorsy things dog training gonna kill her segment on dog training, don't you worry? Yeah, but um, yeah, every episode will be different but we're going to try to stay super honest and real with you guys. You know what one thing that we want to we want our listeners to know. Feel free to go on our social media. Yeah, and if there's an awkward situation that you just can't bring yourself to go through but you want somebody to do it for you to give you advice. \n\nThe Snowman we will that step we will live for that love our conversations because I don't know what it is. Maybe something is wrong with my brain, but I will always volunteer to be the person to tell a complete stranger something weird. Like I it doesn't faze me. I don't I don't know why but like this all for helping you guys out in those weird situations. So messages comment on our stuff will probably ask some questions based on this episode, but I'll go through our social media again. Our Instagram is Let's Be \n\nLet's take pod Twitter is Let's Be the letter B underscore realistic and I forgot that I created an email for us. So if people want to send us emails they can it's the same as Instagram. ",
        "So it's let's be realistic POD at gmail.com. Yeah, don't suddenly me hate mail because we'll just delete it. Yeah. Oh, I mean tell us we want criticism for sure but constructive criticism little bit nice. Please eat something before you give us constructive criticism. Preferably also work out. Yeah work out. \n\nSomething and then you can tell us what we're doing wrong. Yeah. I'm sure there are plenty of things. We're doing wrong. This is our first time ever. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a lot. Oh, yeah, but thank you for being here. Thanks for listening, and we will see you next time. Thank you. Bye. \n\n"

Hello. \n\nWhy would it turn out is incredible I marks Marling and I'm Zack Steward Ponte a welcome to Crime town. \n\nSo we started this sort of in a very organic fashion and one of the guys we met early on was was Dan Barry whose works for the New York Times writes for the New York Times, but previously it worked for the Providence Journal and it was when a Pulitzer Prize there and he was sort of our consiglieri our Guru and he showed us the way so he and he very nicely volunteered to be the MC tonight. ",
        "So you guys have heard enough of \n\nSee no need to hear us talk anymore will be at the end will come back and answer questions, but welcome to the stage, Dan Barry. \n\nSo let me tell you how I came to this as a young reporter who back then had hair. I I was working in North Central, Connecticut and you know working for a small newspaper covering school board's High School graduations religious cults, you know as you do and so I needed to get a job elsewhere. And so I looked \n\nProvidence \n\na friend of mine said that it was a reporter's theme park. Okay that appealed to me. So I threw some clerical error. I got hired and and I fucking loved it. Alright, it was like living in film Noir with the Marx Brothers somewhere. Do you know what I mean? Even even the smell of it? You know you could smell. \n\n",
        "At Bay and there was still just a hint of Menace in everything, you know, so I used to ride around in car one car one was the car that will copper Porter's shared at the Providence Journal. It was like a dumpster from a Dunkin Donuts on Wheels. You know, I mean, it was old newspapers and half eating bagels and it had a police scanner and so you could hear you know, the miseries of Providence all night. That was my radio listening to the miseries. \n\nAnd it was always like the sound of the city trying to cough up something unpleasant and writhing around a car one. I would slow down and front of the coin o matic which was the squad building. That was the headquarters for New England organized crime as we all know the headquarters for a Mandela's patriarca and in the afternoon, I'd be riding around and I turn on the radio and I would hear a talk show. \n\n",

Let's see if you recognize \n\nThis voice Bucky says you got any friends that want some cocaine next thing. ",
        "I know I'm by the scale and I buy my first kilo of cocaine. My frisky was 62,500. It was all the money in the world and I made it over 22,000 profit on it. Was that easy like that. There was no stop. No stop. \n\n",
        "Pop please welcome Charles Kennedy AKA The Wolf aka the ghost \n\nThank you. ",
        "I'm very humble that everybody is here. It's truly is amazing being part of Providence in the dubious distinction of being very corrupt. Well, I help promote that that label for many years. \n\n",
        "So trolls you're all so shy. Yeah, so you you grew up in Oakland Beach kind of a middle-class kid working class family, right? Very middle-class. Blue-collar Mom and Dad's strict Irish Catholics eat those vegetables. Say your prayers at night, right? And so how did you go this way early on I developed quite an interest in blocks in locksmithing which would carry on into my chest. \n\n",
        "Although as sweetheart and one of the earliest episodes that I can remember was I had a a dog and I was living in an apartment house. That dog's name was Sach it was a Dalmatian and I remember coming home one afternoon late one afternoon. ",
        "And my first wife comes out and I says they got Sach I said who's got stash. It was animal control. So now I have a formula. \n\nI laid a plan of action. I'm going to go to the city dog home and I'm going to do a jailbreak. I got my lock picks and off I go I'm now at the city door count and if there's nobody around and sure enough I look in there this Sach looking up at me as a little Tails going back and forth or worry pal have you out of there in a minute? So I picked the lock and I open the padlock and \n\nSprang Sachin as I'm looking over this eight other dogs and they're on death. Row again. There's no tomorrow for these guys. My conscience is bothering me so much. You don't believe in capital punishment. They have no not at all. I proceeded to pick every padlock and spring every dog. Listen go. Just get out of here and unbeknownst to me. Somebody took down my \n\nthis plate and 15 minutes later. There's three for Warwick police cruisers outside and they ring the doorbell I go. Yes, I have come outside with the dog. What dog don't play games get them out here. I surrendered myself in the dog. They locked me up. They lacked Sach up. He's in one car one Cruiser. I'm in the other. He's looking at me. I'm looking at him and we take and they bring us to the \n\nStation the cuts his paws behind a he was cough they cuffed and stuffed them. All right. So you moved on though from canine Escape. So I bet there's a lot of moments. Why don't you tell us about the biggest score? ",
        "It's funny. You should bring that up. And and why would that be Charles actually 23 years ago to this very Night In This Very City \n\nI stole over 1.1 million dollars out of the back of a trunk of a car and it was great night. It was the best I ever had. Like. Wow Brooklyn's been good to you. It's been good to me. Tell us a little more about that. This was a car that was parked in front of a tenement house and I'm a pretty good thief, but I don't wear an invisible suit and there's people coming up and down. \n\nUp and down the stairs. I said man, you know, this is going to be difficult. I did happen to have an assistant what meal at night a little exotic dancer beautiful girl and I sit recently placed her an advantage point where I said, I just need a few minutes or I can pick this lock and get in there just stood there. I got behind the bumper. I pick that lock and I open that trunk and I'm looking in and there's a hockey bag. \n\nNow I unzip that hockey bag and Dan it was loaded with cash. It was just so heavy. I sling it over my shoulder and I'm walking down and here I am the hockey bag all this money and it was a beautiful feeling that was my best but it came at some cost eventually eventually they did catch you right eventually. I was informed on which I knew rugby my \n\nOn for which is almost always the way right off for guys like me it is. Yeah, right, of course before teen years is a for adenine almost 40 years some time looking back. Would you do it again the same way and it's rhetorical question philosophical question. Sometimes I say, I would and all the times I say there's no amount of money in the world. Would I ever do that? But in the meantime, you know, I had a great time. I had a lot of fun it afforded me a lifestyle that I \n\nI never could afford it. And again I had that rebellious streak in me. I was adrenaline. Junkie. I loved it. I loved living on the edge and that edge cut me in two. \n\nCharles County Becky \n\nit's a lot of car trunks and Brooklyn will be broken into tonight. ",
        "Huh? There's always the guy who's going to get the money that isn't really his money. And then there's the guy who's trying to catch that guy who's always trying to get the money that is in his money, right? So, let's see if you crime Town junkies recognize these voices. I almost shit my whole career on Tony for your way. To be honest with you. ",
        "He was a saint \n\nHis whole career he was just a rookie patrolman They promoted him from patrolman to detect them to everything. They were all the way up to the Head of the State Police. I met his whole career. \n\nSo here are the sunshine boys. \n\n",
        "Brian Andrews the former state police detective Commander for Rhode Island and the former Master Thief, Tony Fiore \n\nWhich one is which? All right. So Brian, when was the first time you heard the name Anthony Fiore? She was Anthony W3 date of birth, January 13th, 1943. He lived a 34C the street and Johnston, Rhode Island and drove a brand-new Cadillac with f 6. \n\n",
        "One for on the registration plate and I first met Tony in 1975 while they were on the Run he and a couple other guys at offloaded one of their stolen tractor trailer trucks in a wooded location in Cranston, Rhode Island, and we will waiting for them down at the bottom of the driveway and I arrested Tony at gunpoint. ",
        "I met him at the end of my 357 Magnum \n\nThat's a lovely story how you two met. \n\nThe Tony maybe you have a different version know the first time I met Brian was that the looking down on a barrel of his pistol down the bottom of that Hill. He looks better without that in front of them, right? All right, so then time goes by and fate brings the two of you together again, right after Tony served his jail sentence. I began doing \n\nEllen's of Tony of his house. I started off on his Street in a van watching the house. Well, I don't know maybe my first second or third night in the van on the street. It was dark out was in the winter of 1978 the band pulls up in front of my house and I'm looking out the window and it stops so I'm watching watch it. Nobody gets out of the van. So about 15 minutes later. I said, there's something wrong here I go out and I walk towards the van and the back windows got \n\nPapers on them they covered I said ohalright all of a sudden my van starts rocking up and down and sideways. It was him and one of his other guys, they made me parked in the van on the street. ",
        "So they give me the business they jumped on the bumpers and they will bouncing around in the van. So I get up on a bump object, but I pull the back door open and they're sitting in there are installed so, you know looking out the thing, so obviously after that we could no longer watching from \n\nStraight he was on the Move. We couldn't follow him. You know, he was a guy that took me down all the dead end streets. The only way you could follow Tony was with an airplane. We used to rent airplanes and we used to put the aircraft up in the aircraft. Sometimes would be up on him all day long and he went back to work again. Go ahead. Well, I went down to the Biltmore Hotel in Providence and they used to have these. \n\nAll Aboard a trade books you could just take a book and it had every goal company in the in the United States in it and they would have how much they had on hand and gold. So now I didn't even have to go out and look for places where the goal because I added those look in the book. So now I see this place that says then the back and Kelis so I go get my friend in Boston, which was the alarm guy and I told him I says I got a \n\nThey should go to come and look at down in Rhode Island. We check out the building and we're looking for the wires to the alarm, but they were underground and they ran they have a manhole in the woods where the wires rant road so he could sound in Nova period of the week we're reading the wires and he says well, you know, I'm pretty sure about you know, I could do this I can get to say LOM I says well we got to do I'll chop some cables that's in the area. \n\nI says unless way here I'm going to knock everybody out, you know, so once the Salam so and I chopped the cables 60,000 telephones in knocked out of service. So I go and if I need a building that got a big Hatchet and I'm hitting the cable and it's just bouncing off a me because it's a real thick thick cable Spock's will coming out and look like Fourth of July, you know and everything. So finally I get it chopped nobody had telephone. \n\nNobody could call anything and I said, well, you know, it's Gotta Go with the it's part of the game, you know. \n\nBut it really didn't work out that good because they were waiting for us up. ",
        "There been a back in place was a Refinery with ten million dollars in gold inside. So they were working out working on the alarm system. He's out shopping the cables and we were in an ambush team outside in the woods. So we had the jump up State Police FBI in the chase was on WE chased them in the woods all night long. They had the place surrounded. \n\nNow I'm in the woods. So now I end up, you know, walking motion the whole night through the woods, but I was from Rhode Island. ",
        "So I know it and I walked all the way through the woods and I found a you know a restaurant and I called my friend Charlie Kennedy. I said Charlie I said, I need help I said I'm a back of the restaurant. I said we had a problem. ",
        "So this was like four o'clock in the morning. He said I'll be right there. So he drove up there and he pulled up and he you know, he picked. \n\nMe up and you know, there was like four of us. They didn't get one guy was from Boston an old guy at the time and he comes out of the woods. He's been in the woods son or a couple of days and he's spitting up by mosquitos. He he was in a swamp. So he sees the building. So he runs into the building to make a phone call and it was the state police barracks. So when he goes into the state police barracks, they looked at them. \n\nThat was it they arrested them but I got to the restaurant and you know, I got away for a short while because they come and arrest me. Anyway, after everything was over and that was the end of Fender back and Kelis, you know, and he did his turn he has for it though. ",
        "Like I told him whenever specialist should buying no hard feelings. You've got a job. I had a job. This was my job, you know, so you know, what are you gonna do? \n\nDo it's kind of beautiful. Isn't how crime Town brought the two of you together. Again, that's a captain Brian Andrews and Tony Fiore. Thank you. \n\nAppreciate you having us up here enjoyed the New York people. \n\nSo we're going to take a little break here, but an intermission so I can get a beer or something. \n\nHey, this is Flora Lichtman from the show every little thing on elt.

        "Alright, we're going to start the second half of the program. You've probably heard a consistent. Shout out to Bill malinowski and Bill malinowski was a longtime reporter at the Providence Journal and as much as I'm interested in all this stuff this history and it's not really Mafia Nostalgia to me. It's really just one aspect of the human condition and the one person with whom I could share all. \n\nAll this stuff all these little details and nicknames and wall that stuff was Bill malinowski was a very close friend of mine. And so as we're sitting here talking about this stuff and listening to these great guests I think of him and so he passed away last year, but he's with us in spirit and his wife Mary Murphy and his daughter Molly are here. It's a round of applause. \n\nI've always wanted to stand up for the underdog. And in this situation Raymond was the underdog he had the whole might of the government against him why to take this frail guy with one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel and stick them in prison. I mean, I saw a very different side of him. \n\n",
        "I saw a very sick man who felt persecuted with some you know with some reason. I'm not saying that he was you know an angel but it wasn't my job to decide his guilt or innocence. Dr. Barbara Roberts. \n\nDan can I ask you a question first? No, whatever happened to ladies. First. I have to follow these four consummate acts. They're really hard act to follow. I'm not criticizing you. \n\nso doctor \n\nWell, first of all just do a little bit of your Vitae, you know your credentials. How about that? ",
        "I went to Case Western Reserve school of medicine and I was the second female intern accepted into the internship University Hospitals of Cleveland. \n\nI then did a medical residency at Yale-New Haven hospital and then I spent two years at the National Institutes of Health and the lipid metabolism branch and helped design the first study that prove that lowering cholesterol lowers your risk of cardiac events. Then I went to one of the Harvard teaching hospitals the Peter bent Brigham and I did my Cardiology Fellowship there. \n\nAfter that, I was in full-time academic medicine for two years on the faculty at Penn State's medical school and in 1977. I decided to come to Rhode Island and go into private practice, but still maintain an academic position and I've been on the voluntary faculty at the brown medical school since then and still am to this day. \n\n",
        "And then on top of that you have the honorific of the doctor broad, correct? Why don't you tell us a little about that the first time I heard myself described as the doctor brought it was in a phone call from a gentleman that I had dated a few years before I became Raymond seniors physician and he called me and he said I was talking to well guys the other \n\nOf the other day and he said to me if any remember that dr. Broad you used to go out with she's the old man's doctor now and I thought it was hilarious because to me abroad was somebody with big tits and no brains and I was just the opposite least. I was sure about the that I didn't have big tits. I'm trying to figure out how to follow that you become. \n\nUm the go to doctor for raiment senior, right? Yes, so you become trusted tell us a little bit about how the professional became personal was there blurring of the lines there over the over the course of those few years. I don't think that it was a blurring of the lines, but I think we don't mean ethically. ",
        "Yeah. No, I'm we became close emotionally because we were going through a very unique situation, you know, I took a Hippocratic oath to put my \n\nInterest before my own I didn't take Hippocratic oath to only put patients who didn't have a felony record put their interests ahead of my or someone who'd never been accused of a crime to me. The question of his guilt or innocence was not important. What my obligation was to to keep him alive to the best of my ability and I was absolutely convinced that the stress of a trial would kill him and he knew \n\nAt some level. I mean for a long time. I think he'd been hiding how sick he really was. I mean, he was the alleged head of the patriarca crime family. He had to be Invincible in a we know Raymond patriarca from the steel, I declare and all the photographs, but you knew him in kind of his dumbest disa T. Didn't you you knew him when his guard was a little bit down once a week. ",
        "I would drive out to Johnston and Rita would make us lunch and we would sit there and \n\nAnd have lunch and then I would examine him and and occasionally to cheer him up because he was basically on home confinement. Occasionally. I would bring my youngest daughter. ",
        "She was four years old at the time. So she was in Nursery schools half a day and she just became very close. ",
        "She called him Uncle Raymond, but they had to Toy Poodles Jabo and pepe what were their names Jabo and pepe today of \n\nYou know, I didn't ask me it's quite possible Charles Perrault. Jabo should have had a record because what Jabba would do is a minute Megan sat down he would run up and start humping her leg and Raymond scene you would get apoplectic he would be so Furious. He would roll up the paper and scream and yell and throw things at the dog and say Rita get this dog out of here Jabo survived and it looking back. \n\nBack, would you do it all over again? ",
        "It was highly anxiety-inducing. I think right much of it. But the whole journey of this cardiologist well regarding the medical field then having this other aspect to her life. That wasn't shared by her brother and sister cardiologists, right is this safe to say ya know there were you know, there were Physicians to stop referring my patients because I was taking care of Raymond, but I think that was counter balanced by all the people who refer themselves to me. \n\nBecause they figured if Raymond goes to her she must be good. So therefore I'm gonna go work. It was good for business. It was very good for business. ",
        "Did you advertise that? No, no. No, although I said that no matter what I wanted it to say on my gravestone. It would say she was Raymond's doctor. Right? Right, right. Thank you very much doctor. Dr. Bob. \n\n",
        "Just give us a second. We're going to get some chairs. We have some nosy questions from the audience. This one is addressed to Tony. What did you do with the money? I helped out a landing City a lot. \n\nJust lift it up. But mostly the gambling had a few houses like I had four marriages. So each wife had to get a house. That's very kind of you. And like I say it was the cars the gambling the partying just spending it. I mean, it don't really last that long when udk mean you might get 400,000 you're in and then two months later you're looking for another score. \n\nYeah, I've had that experience. \n\nOkay. This might be a question for well, pretty much anybody here other than being wives girlfriends dancers. What was the role of women in organized crime? ",
        "Why don't women appear on the organization charts? \n\nLet's ask. Mr. Wallison. I plead the fifth. \n\nThis is an online question from Patrick. Thank you Patrick. Did you ever consider going back to your industry after your release? Why didn't you Tony would you think that going back to what you specialized in back in the early 90s, there's a big difference from now back then they show sophisticated. Now. The number one problem that you have is the cell phones now you come. \n\nI'm out of a bank or you're robbing an armored truck. You got people chasing you down the street on a cell phone column every street you're on every move you're on and this cameras on every building. ",
        "It's hard to find a place where there's no cameras or somebody chasing you with the cell phone and it's so inconsiderate that way it's Charles. I know where my business that foreign exports a weed is it's a foregone conclusion. \n\nAs you now there's more marijuana produced domestically and now the state is set to take that away from guys like me. They took my job took my job away. So things have changed dramatically on that. I need work those sons of bitches marker Zach. ",

Yeah, because yeah that or just in case people thinking where's that name from originally a lot better? \n\nYes o talk as you sort of give a little bit about yourself to our listeners. Yeah, so I'm currently at the University of Bradford. I've just started my third year and I'm studying for an integrated Master's in sports Physiotherapy and exercise medicine you are in are you on reading week at the moment now, we've just come home because I'm playing hockey in Manchester this weekend for this God card. Well, yeah, that was a little bit loud, right? \n\nGoing to give a very brief outline of the discussion as always. So for the first off, I want to talk about state school life and also playing hockey at the same time maybe being a part of two different social crowds, maybe the difficulties that you may have faced their at times and this obviously links to just playing sport generally growing up playing a lot of sport hockey and then trying to balance your social life whilst playing, you know, what is \n\nit was a tremendous amount of sport and I'm sure a lot of people I'm sure I'm resonates with a lot of people including Ross and myself after what will be a remarkable pointless fact of the day. ",
        "We're going to talk about what it's like being at Uni. All of our guests have been slightly older and they spoke about what it was like, but it's nice to get that perspective of what it is like now and why people should go to UNI I guess and I think that'd be a nice thing to take us through to our surprise. \n\nYeah, I've been at the end of quite jealous used to it. You need to be honest. I don't I don't like to see you where I went to you last week and and I realized how good of a time I actually had a quite a Mystic ring box. It's been yeah friends are obviously like in their third year now and they're graduating this year and I'm just like thanking so much that I've still got under the year. Yeah wouldn't want to be graduating this year. It's Bleak when you finish it. This is just bizarre. \n\nJust ended the education Road, isn't it? You just can't really get your head round it. See we're currently going through that limbo stage now Army of just trying to pad out what we're going to be doing for the rest of our lives pretty much so so tough period but we'll get onto this second art. So to start off you went States called in you for your entire teenage years officer. Yeah, so I started off at my local high school by Mile High \n\nWhich was you know what it's a good school, but I just found myself struggling to find like a crowd to fit in with for most of my time there because obviously it's not you know, it wasn't very sporty a lot of the girls and you know and Lads that were there. I just we just didn't have very much in common. So I actually spent the first like three or four years actually struggling to find like a crowd to fit into and ends up with it with a great. \n\nBunch of friends, but you know, I'm going to be honest. I don't really see them or speak to them now just because we went we went our separate ways and we have very different interests and stuff. But actual Spike actual school. I did I did quite enjoy and it was that the main reason why you moved for six or was it because of that maybe lack of a solid friendship grew yeah, I think so. I think I just wanted to get get, you know, being a slightly different environment and you know, obviously \n\nThe opportunity to meet new people and stuff which isn't a son by mean a lot of people move for six formed in their new surroundings and I suppose it's the same Principle as when you go to UNI is what wasn't it's always good to if I want to say freshen up and start start anew. So yeah, so I moved in six form as well and it was very different environments who's to a lot smaller school. There's a mixed school as well and I think \n\nObviously people can't do it. But I think people are stuck at the same school because you have to be in a sense not many people actually move schools. I think it's a really good thing to do if you get the opportunity because again, it is just a completely different environment. Did you enjoy your new school more? Yeah. I loved it. It was like the best to eyes are as the same to be far. I've just changed me to be honest. I'm friends with like all those girls and boys that I met there now, so they're you know, they're like my best friends. ",
        "It was a bigger. \n\nWell, it was in a sense. Yeah, because it was it was a high school and sixth form whereas Brahma was just the high school. So yeah, it was but the sixth form was quite separate to the main school to be fair. ",
        "Okay. And so you started obviously you've stopped and small from a younger age. But did you feel that when you're at your first when you're at high school? Sorry that hockey was that you played that give you a way out. \n\nfriendship group as such you know, yeah, so the girls that I played hockey with at the weekend were generally from like the private school private school thing and you know, I might have a sort of struggled in the first I'd say a few months of getting to know them because it was so different and not in any way better or you know, yeah better than any of the girls or boys that I was mates with that school, but \n\nscared me a completely different like I know completely different environment and \n\nDid you find it hard to sort of balance those different environments of that make sense to try and go between the two? Well, I found that I actually ended up wanting to spend a lot of my time with the hockey girls and I got a little bit of grief from my friends at school who would say, you know, you're always with your hockey friends and you never want to hang out with us, but we just you know, those those school girls, they'd want to go to the park and drink vodka out of her out of it. \n\nCome not just wasn't me at that at that age. I'd just rather be playing Sport and you know having a mess around. Yeah absurd as this a local Hockey Club that you went to. Yeah, so I was that old lie. I cha Club Luke's sister Lily. He's still one of my yes bestest friends indeed and it's interesting cause you both had that some of the path and I suppose it's a nice way. It's a to take us on to this issue, which is very prevalent at balancing sport growing up. \n\n",
        "And your social life and I know that my sister's also had had that at times. I've certainly had that Andros had that as well. ",
        "It's tough. Isn't it suppose it? Can you can you shine light on when it started becoming difficult was it like 16 17 or did that start before? ",
        "Yeah, I'd say it was probably when I went to when I went to sixth form because that was actually the first opportunity. I had to represent England. That was when my hockey became quite serious. I moved to a new club and I was playing \n\nAnd a much higher leagues and I was previously so hockey started to get quite serious and with the England stuff. ",
        "It sounds everyone sort of is like always like why why why but when I first got the call up, I really really didn't want to do it because I just knew what I had heard from, you know friends who had done it in the younger age groups before me that it was really intense and you know, you had to you had to give up quite a lot especially weekends and \n\nyour holidays and stuff and I just thought I'd I'm not sure it's for me, but I went on and did it anyway because I knew that I'd probably regret it if I didn't because it was probably going to be my last chance and I did I'm so glad I did it now, but at the time there was a lot of you know, there'd be one day or two day camps at the weekend and there'd be a party on that Friday night and I really struggled so say no and and you know spend the \n\nAnd not drink learn whatever and stay away from my friends just so I could travel three hours in the morning to go to go to that camp where I just feel exhausted the whole time. She mentioned the sacrifice is how often were you training a week? ",
        "So Club wise it will have been twice with a match at the with at least one match at the weekend. And then the that camps the England stuff would be maybe one or two days every three or four weeks. ",
        "It was there too. \n\nYou know too much but it was yeah with school stuff as well. Go matches the school work as well. Did that impact the school worked or well sixth form. I actually had quite a quite an easy two years academically because I actually did a sport be Tech which not to blow my own trumpet, but I was too clever for really so academically I wasn't really being challenged but I didn't want to do a levels. \n\nBecause there wasn't there wasn't three or four subjects that I was actually interested in. ",
        "So I knew that I just I'd probably go in and you know, not really try hard and stuff. Whereas the sport is. Definitely. I knew I wanted to go along that route. So that's what I decided to do because that seems to be a reoccurring theme in these pods is that people do subjects that they don't enjoy and it has a big impact as well. So doing something you enjoy we just want to say is honestly so important it makes it bearable but \n\nYeah, with the sport thing, you know the amount of times especially at 217 I'd say 70 is really the age when people start to regularly go out we'll have how spies quite regularly and that's when it becomes tough when you have a match the next day and you go and then you know, I are gonna have to go home early. You know, it becomes you question whether it's worth it. I think no matter what level you play. I need played for England and that's honestly amazing, but you don't if it's \n\nCertainly, there's a period I definitely went through that when I was playing rugby and Cricket. I felt I was missing out on a lot and I think I went that way and I just kind of gave up playing a little bit on training as hard as I should have because you want to make it professionally don't wait any longer and I think I just got sidelined with the social life essentially, which I think a lot of people do but it's good that I really rate the fact that you thought this might be the only or the last opportunity had to yeah, okay. \n\nSo for England, so I think that's really really good. Yeah, because I knew that I probably wasn't going to make it sort of to the senior level and I didn't think I was that good so that sort of that demotivated me in the sense that I was like am I just doing this for four sort of no reason not not quite good enough thing. Is it like you've got a take anything you do to the highest possible level you can which is you know, that's what you'd encourage anyone to do it regardless of Spore or academics. \n\nYou want to take you want to be the best that you can be or take it further so it can go and and to do that is very admirable because I feel that a lot of people especially with sport probably give up before they've taken that leap to the next level. ",
        "Yeah, because it's tough but you look back and you think wow, you know, I played for England. Yeah. Thank you rather than think. I wish I didn't I wish my uncle actually when \n\nI was struggling at school with the getting the balance, right? He said look in a few years time you're going to go for the interview on you and they're going to like what what experience if you got what grades have you got? What have you done to make itself more interesting and you're going to go in there and you're not going to be like actually, you know that night Lola lows on the Saturday when we all got really plastered and obviously had a good time, but you're not going to be saying that sighs he's got to really think about it and hard on decide for you. ",
        "What is best obviously having fun is great. \n\nYou've gotta live in the moment. Exactly. Yeah, and I think like Luke so playing freeing than is an incredible achievement that you can be very proud of thank you. I need encourage people to play sport as much as possible wouldn't yeah, I understand is so important. I don't understand people that don't play sport. I just what do you do? I don't catch obviously have other Hobbies, but I just think sit on the toilet on my phone right now. What do I do that in play? But yeah, it's a great. \n\nGreat thing to be done. I think the other element as you touched on throughout is the social isn't it you me really good people and having that team is really about no matter how bad a week you've had with work or whatever. You got to T me got a group of people that gives you a separate world, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah, definitely think now especially at my at my current Club Brooklyn's there is a massive social side to it as well. As you know, we play a high level hockey, but you know what out every other \n\nYou can do Manchester having a having a really fun time and that's you know, that's a massive part of why I'm team bonding as well. It doesn't I really really really that I want to go back involved with sports be fair. This is it's a great thing to do while you're young when you still can before this lie, maybe work becomes too much of a commitment at times so actually the view I want to go down and yeah, my weekends might not be as free but and I'll tell you what we will touch on that on the second half to keep the \n\nThe listeners captivated and wanting more let's break up this conversation with probably lose fact of the day release and that one. Oh, yeah. And so we are going to do a point as fart. The gas has the choice of going first or last what would you prefer? I'll go first good answer. We've got new note C. This is awesome. It's quite short and sweet. But basically I learned the other day that your right nostril is wider and longer than \n\nYou're left to every person. Yeah interested. Is it your nostrils? You just flat-out lie. But yeah, I'm glad now because say that he's I was bad. So we start recording these podcasts. I think that's on the cards, isn't it? And you beside yeah. That's a good one. I think everyone's gonna start doing that and yeah, isn't it? \n\nOkay. Mine is a short and sweet one as well. And so we all know who Charlie Chaplin is. ",
        "So Charlie Chaplin once won third prize in a Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest. ",
        "Is that true? What it says on funny jokes humor fox.com. You must have had to use like a different identity to even get into the no that's good though. If it's true, it's good, but it's got its \n\nEverything we do is true. Sorry. Yes, it's true. How good is that? But yeah, that was good. Right. ",
        "So mine is also short and sweet just to finish an imperfect. So \n\nHumans shed, 40 pounds of skin in their lifetime completely replacing that outer skin every month. \n\nin terms of dust on \n\nskin shed. ",
        "Oh sure hurt. I'm guessing that no one else thought heard share. Did you hear sure? I heard shed sure what you said, but that's sharing is the active share is you were someone else. \n\nSuch a but that's that's pretty Grim than you think. Yeah. So there you go a range of pointless facts today and that concludes pointless fights with the dairy beautiful. So just before we get onto that we touched upon what you're gonna do in the future and I think that links to what you're doing right now, which is being at Uni I said this I said you're at Bradford unique currently on you and you're doing you've got two more years or a year and a half. Yeah. Third year I'm doing for also. \n\nOkay, beautiful and we've had some feedback from people saying like let's talk about how good uni is Yuri, you need deal of it. Yeah, absolutely really love it. ",
        "Even though Bradford's not known as one of the best Unis in the country or in the world. ",
        "Yeah, you just you've got to make it what what you can and I feel like you know, me and my friends we definitely do that and just have we just have so much fun. Yeah. What do you think? You sort of learn? \n\nThe most because this is a question that's always a leveled people. Like why do you know? Why did you guys do any one of you learn and is never necessarily about the course. So, you know what sort of things have you learned about yourself? ",
        "And you say well before I went I was always quite good at the whole cleaning and cooking kind of thing, but I was rubbish going and doing things on my own and I'm still not I'm still not great, but I'm definitely more confident. I would just get anxiety if I \n\nAgo and you know go to the bank and I don't know sort something like that out. But you know, I'm living on my own. I can't take my mom with me now. So she more independent. Yeah, that's really good. That's really good. Oh, what's your best dish cooking water? That's a good question. Actually, it's got to be a chili con carne. That's a quite the same. I've never tried that but you can go isn't tried cooking it and you finish the race. Yeah. My my Chili's clock. \n\nGo together to make a veggie chili con carne. That's Annie pop. I'm not tired. But I'm sure I could follow you or do you substitute the beef with? \n\nCorn I'm a massive like me too. So I don't really yeah that that it's just I know you need I was probably the thing that really I learned the most was cooking because I mean I couldn't cut before I went to the at all such an important skill, but do you think the social side of uni is what is the reason people should go if that makes sense? I wouldn't say I'd say it's \n\nImportant reason to go I would say Obviously you always put you course first just because why pay all that money if you're not if you're not going to focus or yeah, look at that right there. Yeah, but no the social side is massive. I've got friends, you know, quite a few who are still living at home and going to like Manchester uni and just traveling em in every day and as much as that's great you saving money and all that kind of stuff, you know, I wouldn't \n\nI just wouldn't be without real friends I've made now and you know, I just think it's it's really important to just put yourself out there. ",
        "Even if you not that kind of person and so you touched on the friends at Uni that you've made so other friends at Uni that you have similar to your friends at home or are they different? I have a yeah cupola a couple I say this to her face. I'm like if I knew you at school, I would either would be your friend or wouldn't but \n\nYou just it forces you to make, you know be with people that you yeah that you wouldn't necessarily have chosen to be friends with before but even but now again, they're people I wouldn't be without so it's you know, it's so cool to be fans with such a different variety of people, you know with different interests. ",
        "And yeah, can I ask you a question and so Luke and I went to UNI is where a lot of the student population was from \n\nUm London where our moves to your friends from a lot. Well my friend so God all over to be fair. I've got one lad who's from Rochdale. So yeah another from Portsmouth. So he's already has his family like twice a year. She goes home for Christmas so far. ",
        "That's that's not properly on the coast. Yeah. She lives on the beach. \n\nAnd then one from scunthorpe North Lincolnshire. She's right over the other side Norfolk and blond hair Norfolk. Again. That's the spirit rack zero. This is NASA great next day. ",
        "That's literally all I literally I do the see them outside of uni time or as I try. I mean the girl we had a girls holiday earlier this year. We went to Tenerife salary. That was so much fun. Yeah, but it's just hard, you know getting a first look. \n\nGetting a date where everyone's available and you know train fares are just about so the extortionist so yeah, it's a lemur try and we try and meet up over summer. But it's it's quite hard. I think it's quite nice having separate worlds. I say you have your uni life and you when you're at Uni you live it to you know fully don't you see friends as much as you can you be around him and then having that break when you either go home at any holiday or for a week and it's quite nice if it was like a \n\nInstant overlap. ",
        "I think that would probably be helpful to be quite hard. Yeah. No, I'm glad that I can cause obviously I'm not too far. ",
        "I'm in the like an hour and 15 minutes away from home and I have my car so I can I can come home when I drive. Yeah. Yeah, I did that which makes it so, you know, I'm so glad and obviously I'm coming home at least twice a week for hockey over and sale. So yeah, I'm I'm sort of feel when I'm at hockey. ",
        "I feel as if I'm home. \n\nHome, but I'm not if that makes sense or not not always seeing my family and stuff when I'm there. But yeah, no, I'm glad that I'm within touching distance but far enough away that I'm not being smothered by my family when you eat it. Not not really now. I don't know if that sounds really awful don't know because I think it's important. ",
        "This is the problem though when people obviously you're going to miss them at first but you've got to you've got to be your own the last yeah because it's a fact of life is \n\nYou know the E, you're gonna have to go off and do your own thing. That's what happens. So being able to have the balance. And as you said you have the option to give on which is really nice. So maybe having that option for people. It's a way to go. Yeah. ",
        "I try and be at Uni as as much as I can in term time. ",
        "So like my one of my best friend's she's doing physio as well and she's just been on placement for five weeks, but her placement has been at home. So she's spent the first five weeks of \n\nHer last year at Uni living at home. ",
        "And that's I think that's been pretty tough for her because yeah not been with you know, all of us. It's easier being home when you know that everyone's at home and not seeing each other, but I imagine that's been quite hard for her being being away on placement. ",
        "Yeah, could I can ask is well. ",
        "How did you find first year of unity? \n\nGood. Yeah, I mean my course is quite different to a lot of others. I think you guys you didn't have many contacts dollars legit five or six. Yeah, why is mine is like 20 a week if you know if not more so I was quite busy. I quite like having that routine where I know what I'm doing and I'm yeah, I'm busy so first. Yeah first year was good went out enough time still play lots of sports and first. Yeah. Yeah because we've been discussing this \n\nLost my people approached is about talking about this about how hard first year can be and we were saying how important it is to be involved in some sort of sports team or Society. Yeah, just to keep up to yeah, you said I should yeah for sure. I mean the Bradford hockey team bless them were in like the second bottom League I think in books, so it's not a very high standard, but you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't be without its it gives \n\nOh that really so obviously more social more social stuff. ",
        "And again just a great a great way to meet new people because my my hockey fans aren't the friends. I you know, my course mates my like best friends. ",
        "Yeah, but then it's nice to have like the hockey lot as well that I can go and spend a Wednesday Wednesday worth. So with regards to your course you chose that course because you wanted to pursue that after uni, right? Yeah, which is fairly uncommon I would say in this \n\nAnd solve a lot of people don't know I did history and I know if the most common question leveled up me is obviously going to be a history teacher. No, not really. No definitely not but then would you say that people should maybe think about doing a degree that they're going to use going on straightaway? Yeah. Well, I think it's obviously it's really important that you're going to do something that you are really interested in and if that is history, that's that's fine. Even if you don't know. \n\nKnow what you're going to do after but now I feel quite lucky actually that I am doing a course that I know will sort of lead me to some where I where I want to be, you know, we all know the NHS so desperate for for you know, physios nurses midwives and all that kind of stuff. So I know that I'm not going to be stuck for a job at the end of it which is quite reassuring that's really key thing to take away from this as well. Especially looking at me and leaky sadly chakra. \n\nLolly said everyone comes up to me being like you're gonna become a drug for Teacher so they can get hot wearing can't Roar the whole coloring in and lots of it. So I have to keep quiet though. So I just explain what we're doing at the moment, but it's all just a new thing that we want to do with with our guest is could you sort of sum up it sort of three points of what you'd like people to take away from this discussion that we've \n\nI've had. Yeah, so I'd say definitely have a hobby if that is for or if it's if it's something else I think just keep yourself busy. I've had find that having a routine is is really helpful. So yeah, I have a hobby definitely push yourself out of your comfort zone and you know if that means going away from home at Uni and stuff do it and if in the first \n\nIf after the first semester, it's not for you that it's not for you. But at least you've tried it and yeah, just like Embrace every opportunity if you if someone asks you to do something and you're not quite sure then just yeah, just give it a go. I just so I could know I like it. So I mean somewhat put you on the spot with that I know but it's always nice I think for because the guest is the one who's thought about what they want to say and it's nice for you to tell people really you know what but what your call \n\nSo yeah, that was really that was really good considering we hadn't actually probably for that. Yeah. That was my surprise brush. It was really good tan and say, you know being at Uni is it's such a different and I welcome perspective because we just sound like old people I are back in my day. So yeah, we want you to go Unis great. There's nothing I feel like sometimes we just criticize their little bit because it's good to critique it, but it's great isn't it? And you're enjoying yourself. \n\n",
        "Made the most of it again Mark. Yeah, so to finish off I wouldn't have a discussion the gas that we suggest we want to do and we arrived at film of the day some of the day which is very good. One one that we've been thinking about quite long. So should we do it in reverse order from last time? Okay. ",
        "So my film with the day is Interstellar by a directed by Christopher Nolan. ",
        "It's got Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. So the \n\nisn't I mean it's a brilliant film it blows your mind. But the reason it's my favorite ever film is because I went to watch it in the IMAX in town and it's just it was the first time I'd ever been to the IMAX before and you know, the big screen it was just I just completely is the first time I felt like completely lost in a film almost is like it was insane. I came out what back into the daylight outside and I was like Oh my days crazy film if you haven't seen it before you have to watch it is about three hours long, so \n\nSure. Yeah, I love even sure you got some popcorn lots of it but it's worth it. Honestly is undoubtedly my favorite other film. Yeah, I have seen and I've watched it a couple of times first time. I watched it. I fell asleep to be fair shot to re-watch. It wasn't the iron marks face. Was it the iron Mark? ",
        "So mine is called like Rhonda ballots are which is an Italian film that I watched at school. I studied Italian. ",
        "I am translators the great Beauty. So I just give you a brief overview of the plot. \n\nNot so I threw 65th birthday Jap a journalist with a passion for parties and beautiful women finds himself lost between the nostalgic of the past and the uncertainty of the future Jep realizes that he has lived life superficially. So Begins the search for Great Beauty between the declining Bourgeois Z on the stereotypes of society and its really beautiful film. The soundtrack is amazing. ",
        "It's more of a spectacle I'd say that not much really \n\nGoes on it's just the way it's actually filmed on the the scenery and it is filmed in writing but it's really because you have such it's a long film again. It's about three other one the best job in the rhyme you done to your thoughts good suggestion. I like that thought to finish it. Okay, so I'm actually really guilty of just watching the same films over and over and over again. So one of my favorites is The Notebook, which I think everyone is familiar. \n\nSure, I've seen that. Yeah, and I'm also like I just really like films to cry out because I feel like it's the only time I actually really quite first time I watched our there is six of us six boys. We did the same but with Wally, you know Wally the Pixar film. Oh, yeah. Wow, that's the only two things that they say and I remember there was like a load of us boys in the \n\nRemember and we're just all tearing at the guy. Yeah. Yeah, that was a shit film just waiting films are great for that. They give you an hour. Yeah, that's it. That's a good suggestion. The no Burger. I've never seen it. You really really really need to watch it. ",
        "I do some were launched on a rainy day. ",
        "Yeah right now and if you live on a Sunday August suggestions or very different suggestions, so go and check them out. I'll put them in the description I think but to all once again, thank you very much. Come on the podcast. \n\nThank you so much. That was really interesting conversation. And what we hope to have you on again soon and future. Yeah, fantastic. So next time we have an identity lined up, but I don't like to give it away because Hannah someone listen for the end keeps it mysterious doesn't it? But we have online over the last couple days. So until then keep doing what you're doing guys, and we'll be back soon. \n\n"

        "So just a quick back story here, but shortly after I started working as a real estate agent. I hit this really weird plateau in my career really from the age of about 22 23 years old. We're I was stuck making a hundred and forty-two a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year now, it seems really strange to say I was stuck making a hundred and forty two hundred fifty Grand a year, but no matter what I did I couldn't seem to break past that amount. I would show more homes. I would see more clients. I would work more hours, but no matter \n\nwhat I would do I was stuck on earning the same amount maybe plus an extra few grand every single year, you know after the third year of doing this I started getting really frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was holding me back and why I couldn't push through because everything I was doing should have led to a sharp increase in income and this made absolutely no sense to me and it really felt like I was just hitting my head up against a brick wall not accomplishing anything and that was until I reread the book The 4-Hour workweek by Timothy Ferriss and what she describes the \n\nAny principle within one year I blew past two hundred thousand dollars in commission and I worked fewer hours and I worked with less clients. It was actually during this time that I ended up taking about three months off to visit family in Canada while also going to Vegas like every third weekend to eat at the all-you-can-eat buffets. ",
        "I ended up just sleeping in later. I ended up seeing friends more often and somehow I ended up making an extra $50,000 that year and the next year after that was more of \n\nSame I ended up working fewer hours with fewer clients. Somehow ended up making about 250 thousand dollars and even today a few years later. I find myself working fewer hours with fewer clients, but somehow I'm making more and more money every single year. ",
        "So let me explain the strategy and how this 80/20 principle is really going to improve your life and your business. So this whole thing is really just a principle that suggests that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the cause and even though the exact ratios might be a little bit different. \n\nI found this to be true with almost everything. I've done like here are some examples for you and real estate. I found that about 20 percent of my clients led to about eighty percent of my income. Even on YouTube about 20% of the videos. I make lead to about 80% of the YouTube ad Revenue even in clothing. I find that I wear about 20% of the clothing I have about 80% of the time even in customer service or retail. It's found that about 20% of the clients are responsible for about 80% of the complaints and even if you look at anything in your life as well, you should be able \n\nFind that about 80% of your results are from about 20% of your effort. So this leads us to a really good question. And that is what does this all mean. This means that you spend 80% of your time chasing the remaining 20% of the result. And when you phrase it like this, it doesn't really sound like a good use of time. Now does it in theory? You should be able to spend one fifth of your time to get 80% of the results and that is exactly what I ended. \n\n",
        "End up doing if you guys want to know how you went from a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year to two hundred thousand dollars per year and one year with working less. ",
        "I looked through every single clients in mind from the very beginning of my career. And now I identified the ones that produce the most income and identify the ones that I spent the most time chasing after the didn't necessarily lead to an increase in sales. But what I found was actually pretty astounding it turned out I was spending about 80% of my time chasing after these little lease deals in real estate that \n\nDidn't pay a lot of money and this was the most time-consuming thing I did but even though my motto at the time was work with everybody because eventually they're going to buy a home and eventually they might refer you more business the more I looked into it the more I realize that these little lease deals were not buying they were not referring me any significant business and it was really just consuming a large amount of my time on the flip side. ",
        "I found that the clients that spent eight thousand to thirty thousand dollars per month ended up buying between one and three years later. \n\nAnd they ended up referring me significant business. So I pretty much just completely overhauled my entire approach to real estate. And what I ended up doing is just cutting any clients that were spending less than 8 thousand dollars per month. I then Focus that remaining 80% of my day on meeting more people that were spending eight thousand dollars per month to 30 thousand dollars per month that were statistically more likely to buy refer me business and lead to more income and no joke just with this one change. I ended up working less. \n\nAnd somehow making an extra fifty thousand dollars within one year and the next year the same thing, but I then took it to a bit more of an extreme. ",
        "I stopped working with listings that I felt were overpriced. I stopped working with clients who I felt were unrealistic and we're not going to change. I stopped working with people that did not respect my time. ",
        "I focused only on clients that were ready and realistic about buying real estate and by focusing my time on the really serious people and the higher price listings it \n\nit freed up my time to find more serious people and more high price listings. And guess what that next year my income went up another $50,000 now within two years. I'm making an extra $100,000 per year by also working less and the funny thing is the less. I worked the less stressed. I was and the less stressed I was the more clients wanted to work with me and the more clients wanted to work with me meant that I was able to be more selective in the more selective. I was the more money I ended up making and using \n\nExact technique is what led to over five hundred and fifty thousand dollars in Gross commission's last year without prospecting without driving myself crazy without being stressed while still having the free time to make YouTube videos and renovate properties. And how did I do this? It was by cutting everyone out who didn't fit the criteria of the person I wanted to work with and even though I turned down a lot of business this ended up freeing up my time for bigger and better opportunities and each year that I get more selective I end up making more \n\nMore money I take on less but I end up making more and here's what it really boils down to that. ",
        "You can apply right now. See the thing is there's only one thing we're all of us are really on a truly Level Playing Field where no one gets more and no one gets less and we get the same amount of it every single day and that you guys is time. We all had the same amount of time available to us. No matter who we are or what we do given this. It's really how we utilize this time that really sets us apart whether you're a Bill Gates or someone. \n\nInvesting in bit connect for some reason. Our time is really the most limited resource out there. ",
        "Once it's gone. It's gone. You're never getting it back. Once today is over. It is gone forever. Once this month is over. It is never coming back. ",
        "So using this time as efficiently as possible is really essential to maximize your day and get the most out of your time as possible. And this is very easy to get caught in the Trap of jumping over dollars to go and pick up pennies. \n\nMuch like spending 80 percent of your time to chase that final 20% of the result. So this is exactly what you do. So the first thing you need to do is focus on the areas with the highest Roi possible. This is either where you get the most done make the biggest impact or make the most amount of money. There is almost always going to be an 80/20 rule of play where 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort. Find out what this is why this is the way it is and focus on identifying what exactly that \n\nThe second thing you do is identify where you're spending eighty percent of your time that leads to 20% of the result this for me was little least clients that just weren't going anywhere that were consuming a lot of my time even take a YouTube for instance. If I really wanted to optimize this I probably spend about 80% of my time editing 20% of my time filming so I would be able to film five times the content just if I hired an editor, but of course I do this for fun and not trying to really optimize anything but you get the idea \n\nhere find out where you're spending that 80% of your time and either cut it out entirely automated or Outsource it. So once you identify where your time is going and what really leads you to the best Roi make the decision at that point to cut it out and focus your time on doing what works and then the third step is just doing more of the 20% find out what that 20% is and then Focus your time on replicating more of that. This is really just about optimizing \n\nThinking and working efficiently not working harder. It's also about realizing that oftentimes the minority of your effort ends up leading to the majority of your result and it's really just about optimizing what works and leveraging that and getting rid of everything that doesn't work as well. ",
        "And by doing this you should really be able to increase your income work less and make more money. Now, of course, I do want to mention there is a bit of a dark side to doing this for those that take it to an extreme when you do something like this. You just have to be smart and \n\nReasonable about it, like for instance. If you're in a client based business, the fewer selection of clients, you have generally leads to more vulnerability and more risk. For instance. If you're in social media marketing and you have 10 clients, but you realize that two of your clients make up 80% of your income. So you decide to cut out the other 80% of your clients so you can focus more on the to just realize if one of those two clients leave, that's the majority of your income disappearing, so don't necessarily just cut everybody all at \n\nOnce instead you want to do it slowly smartly and efficiently over time. Otherwise, you're exposed to a lot of risk just in the event one of your few remaining clients leaves or changes their mind or doesn't want to work with you anymore, even in real estate. This didn't happen overnight. This was really fine-tuned over a few years to really find the combination that worked as efficiently as possible. This is something you really have to decide for yourself how much money you want to make how much you want to work and how much of that 80% do you really want to spend? \n\nAnd chasing the 20% and if you want to go and chase after everybody go for it. There's really nothing wrong with that. But at a certain point when you get busy enough, you're going to have to focus on the people that really have the best Roi for your time. And with that you're going to have to cut out customers products or people that really are not as productive and that you guys is really the most important component of doing this and this is exactly how I was able to go from about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year to now over 500. \n\n",

        "From gimlet. This is reply-all show about the internet. I'm Alex: and I'm PJ vote and one of the things about doing a show about the internet is that people are often suggesting that you do stories about online dating and we often choose not to and then a few weeks ago our friend Stephanie Foo who's normally a producer at This American Life came to us with this story that \n\nwas unlike any online dating story that either of us had ever heard Stephanie. I'll take it from here. So a couple years ago, I interviewed this girl. Her name is Suzanne. She lives in San Francisco and she'd met this really cute guy on OkCupid and everyone knows that when it comes to online dating people can be really non-committal unwilling to settle down but this guy she met let's call him John right from the beginning John was really warm. ",
        "He just had a way of taking really ordinary little \n\nShins and just making them fun and playful and was very thoughtful would like make me breakfast would like hide like my favorite snacks and my purse and was just a really sweet really sweet loyal person. John was Scandinavian muscular attractive. He seemed unreal like a dream boyfriend. ",
        "He offered her the keys to his apartment really early on in their relationship which surprised her and he gave her a little shelf for her stuff in his apartment and when she told him she had to \n\ngo to the DMV not only did he offer to come he made a date out of it. He made it fun took her to lunch. He even included her in a bunch of his domestic decision-making John was renovating his apartment. ",
        "So we went to see be too and he was looking for the perfect couch. And at one point we had to spoon on various couches to see if they were wide enough for us to spoon on and if you know, hence they would be appropriate for his apartment. The sales girl is kind of low. \n\nGet us and you know, I was kind of thinking my mind like does she hate us right now, but at the same time I was having so much fun. I didn't really care. ",
        "So one day she and John are the park and he leaves to go climbing for a couple hours. Then she gets a text from him saying that he hurt himself at the gym and had to go to the hospital, but it's not that bad and she should just go to his apartment and wait for him Suzanne lets herself in and to kill time. She goes on his computer starts working on a resume. She'd been touching up. \n\nAnd she sees this folder labeled Elizabeth that's just been updated. And at first she feels bad like, oh I shouldn't Snoop on my amazing boyfriend, but her curiosity gets the best of her so she clicks on the folder inside their bunch of pictures. \n\nAnd I see them with this woman. And at first I'm just telling myself, you know, don't freak out. He's allowed to have you know female friends who are attractive. It's not a big deal going through the album. I see photos of them kissing and I'm just completely gobsmacked Suzanne is furious but more than anything she feels like she just needs to know more she doesn't have to wait long minutes later. She sees his Gchat Flash. \n\nShe sees that right now at this moment. He's logged in somewhere else and he's chatting up another girl. Let's call her Serena. It looks like they've never met but he's making plans with her to meet that week and then another box pops up with a girl named Tracy another box pops up with a girl Elizabeth and I'm like wondering is this the same Elizabeth from the photos? And it I see that he says the kind of things to her that he says to me like very sweet. \n\nBoyfriend knee kind of things. I just if you met John you would just think he was one of the sweetest guys and then to just suddenly very quickly all of a sudden find out that they're cheating on you in real time. That was a lot to take in Suzanne text. John to get the hell back to his apartment stat, but when he showed up she thought wait, I don't know anything about who this guy really is. What if he's a \n\nserial killer what if he has a knife. So while he's standing outside the door, she makes him take off all his clothes and strip naked to prove. He doesn't have a weapon finally. She lets him in and they have a huge fight. He tells her that she's the only one who truly loves that nobody else meant anything to him. She tells him she needs to know the whole truth. This goes on for hours. \n\nAnd then the doorbell rang so I opened the door and I'm greeted by a pretty Korean woman and I say who are you and she looks very angry and she she says, who are you and I say I am Suzanne. ",
        "I have been dating John for the past six months, and she \n\nShe says her name is Tara and she has been dating John for the past two years at this point all she knew was that the guy should have been seeing had been cheating on her with at least four other people and now he was fighting with one of them outside his apartment. ",
        "She watched them from the window and actually took a picture of the two of them fighting just to prove that. This was all really happening. She sent me. \n\npicture \n\nTara's looking up at him hurt her hands on her hips. You can't see John's face. \n\nSuzanne is exhausted. She leaves goes home. She decides she wants to warn other women John knows in case he secretly dating them too. But when she tries to go to his Facebook page she finds out he's blocked her but she remembers the names of a bunch of women. She'd seen on his friends list and she sends a mass message to all of them saying watch out if he's dating all of these women at the same time. You may be a victim of John's to and I got the email so I emailed them back. \n\nAnd say hey, it's not just you guys. If you want to talk to me. Give me a call. This is Phoebe, which is not her real name. Phoebe had dated John two years before they met online. This is Phoebe story. She was at his apartment. He wasn't there. She sent him a text saying hey honey, where are you? And he says, oh, I'm just watching TV sitting in your house doing nothing. I have to do homework. \n\nWork that's the text message you get while he I'm sitting on his couch, right? ",
        "So I wait until he comes back and and of course he's got a girl with him and we three of us get in a huge fight and argument about it that happened about \n\nThree different occasions. Whoa \n\nPhoebe love John but after watching him betray her over and over again, she broke up with him in their time together though. She'd actually seen John accumulate two cycles of women in each cycle. He dated up to ten women at once three to four serious girlfriends and several casual relationships on the side. Each time one woman would find out one the whole group and the Harem would implode \n\nIt's kind of like when a spider meticulously creates its web after a storm blows it away. The spider unfazed simply begins again. \n\nThe email Suzanne sent Phoebe was actually the third. ",
        "Hey everyone our boyfriend John's a cheater email that Phoebe had gotten he it is three generations. I've seen so three generations. Oh my God, I like how that you described it as Generations. It's so sick. Yeah, I've seen it all and so what race were all these girls \n\nOh Asian, every single one of them they were all aging girls. And how did that make you feel? \n\n",
        "It was gross. It was very grows and it was quite shocking and he doesn't have to be they don't have to be intelligent. They don't have to pretty they don't have to be skinny. They don't have to be anything. ",

        "So the first half of the show producer Stephanie food was telling the story of a wildly prolific cheater who exclusively targeted Asian women Stephanie picks the story up from here. \n\nOne of the things that struck me reporting this story. Is that the women that John tricked they're all really smart really successful and in general most Asian women already go into online dating with their guard up. We refer to men who only date Asian women as having yellow fever, but nobody had been prepared for John's version the scale of it. And so the women started talking to each other Suzanne Elizabeth and Phoebe got together over some wine and they realized that they really like \n\nEach other here's a Lizabeth the woman who was on the photos in John's computer. ",
        "I think we're able to bond over a shared experience or really poor experience. They were able to help me heal a lot better than a lot of my friends because they knew exactly what I was going through. We spent a lot of time preparing text messages timelines. We compared notes we compared photos. I was telling them. Yeah, that's what we what he did was other girls with me. How about this? \n\nIt's like, yep, he did that to us too. We noticed he had copied and pasted some of the same emails to us. And remember that adorable couch date at CB2 John took multiple girls to that store made them all spoon on all the same couches and when the generations of girls blew up, he told each girl that she was the only one he really loved the more they learned about the depth of his deceptions the more pissed off they got and they wanted to warn people keep other girls from falling into his \n\nSo they made a fake OKCupid profile with this picture and a slight variation on his username. But the whole profile was filled out with warnings. I'm a cheater. If you see me on here don't date me a couple of girls actually emailed them saying hey, thanks. I was actually about to date this guy, but OkCupid took down their fake profile. They said it was a violation of their policies. So do you know what happened to John? ",
        "Like what became of this guy? \n\nNo, he disappeared Into The Ether actually. \n\nI called John a bunch of times over the past couple of years 3. \n\nIs not available. He's never returned any of my calls or emails, but he's a website with his name. And the only thing on the website is a quote that says it's better to be hated for who you are then to be loved for who you are not he's like the Joker like he's like an actual villain. He also speaks in like dumb supervillain platitudes. Yes. Yeah. He's like Ice King locking up Asian girls in his eyes. \n\nA while ago. I also looked up John's OkCupid account. He was still on there his profile said he was interested in a relationship. ",
        "That is a crazy story like that person is beyond evil. Yeah, and it freaked me out it terrified me as an Asian woman, and if I hadn't known if I hadn't talked to these girls, it could have been me. \n\nI mean, I was in a relationship when I first met Suzanne, so like the threat was still kind of theoretical but last year I actually became single for the first time in a long time and I went on dating sites and I realized that sites like OkCupid and match.com make it super easy for men with yellow fever to Target their prey because all you have to do is click on the Asian box in the search engine and then bam, there it is. \n\nAsian girl theme park. Okay, I get that but also like just to play devil's advocate here. ",
        "A lot of people tend to date people of One race, like most people have a type. Right right and people are always telling me like, what's the problem? What if I have a preference for Jewish girls and I'm like OK Google image search Jewish girl and Google image search Asian girl do it. \n\nJewish girls is there's a lot of \n\nPictures of there's like pictures of Anne Frank Julia Louis-Dreyfus. There's like Orthodox Jewish women. There's like jutra it they're like, it's a total diversity of options of people Fran Drescher. ",
        "When you go to Asian women, it's mostly woman standing in fields. Yeah, they're like almost all standing in fields bikinis. I'll give you had never met an Asian woman in your life and you were an alien and you had to learn about from Google image search. \n\nSearch it would be like sometimes they are toddlers but they quickly mature into innocent sexy women in fields. And that's how they spend their lives. That's how I spent my morning. I was in a bikini and I feel this morning. But like how do you have like a preferred field that you like filled with dandelions big fans of big fan of those? I like to traipse in a nut doesn't help Asian women very much like \n\nAll these girls are seen as really submissive and just sort of solely there for your sexual gratification. So like this physical expectation is coupled with this really problematic cultural expectation. \n\nThat helps me understand and in your case, you're like I like girls who I can pray on because they're so easy to prey on like that leaves the association's for that. Yeah precisely. I mean I get that not every guy who's dated an Asian girls a jerk, right? Not every guy's dating like a flock of us at a time, but take reasonable my OkCupid inbox like like a huge portion of my messages are from guys going on about \n\nRace and my exotic looks and my almond eyes and then on top of that there are actually all these strangers messaging me trying to warn me about other guys with yellow fever just like Suzanne and those other girls did a few months ago a woman. ",
        "I didn't know saw an innocuous interaction. I had with a guy on Twitter. She wrote to me to tell me it'll watch out that the guy had yellow fever and would try to hit on me and he did and released soon after. \n\nI matched with another dude on a dating website who messaged me that he had a warn me about something and told me to call him. So I did he asked me to modify his voice for this story. ",
        "Hi, um. \n\nSo hello. Yeah. Hi. Hello. Yeah. Hey what's going on? I'm I don't know you tell me I'm car. Yes, I am. Yeah, so \n\nYou know, the reason I asked you to stated it's just sort of like what's the self-preservation aspect of it? You know, it's better for me the less less girls. \n\nAround the city spreading genital herpes is you know, I've avoided it this far. ",
        "So I'd like to continue that Trend. So this caller tells me this elaborate story of a guy. Let's call him Adam who apparently dated only Asian women many Asian women at the same time. He manipulated them abuse them gave him herpes and this other guy was calling to warn me, but I didn't know whether to be grateful or terrified. It was scary enough if he was telling the truth. \n\nWith but what if he was one of those guys what if he was making up a story so he could take advantage of my fears about yellow fever and try to be a hero so he could hit on me too. What am I supposed to believe? That sounds pretty awful. ",
        "I mean online dating in general is terrible. It sounds like online dating as an Asian woman is like pretty hazardous. ",
        "I mean, how do you deal like, how do you how do you decide who to trust? Well when I asked \n\nPhoebe that question she said this thing that surprised me she said that if you're an Asian woman, it's your responsibility to already know that this is going to happen to you and just be educated about this stuff. So yellow fever serial dater cheaters manipulators. They are everywhere you go. \n\nAnd one stopping one guys and just like a tip of Iceberg. Yeah. It's way too many of them to catch them to the point that it's just like well, you gotta figure it out. Like we don't need to warn you. I like you should already know that all the you know, how to figure this out. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. It's just we just have to learn how to spot these guys and I mean, I'd sad that say that I you know, he takes a couple practice do it. But how do you figure it out now? How do you approach dating now, too? \n\nPrevent being getting involved with a guy who preys on Asian women. The first thing we asked the list of ex-girlfriend's if last five old girlfriends are all Asian, then we stir asking more questions. I totally used the same method Phoebe does because in my experience of confronting guys with you. \n\nYellow fever I don't want to date guys who have dated more than two Asian girls before me. Okay, so this is a little bit weird. But so my girlfriend is Chinese. I feel like I have to also say that she is the first Asian woman who have dated but relatively early in our relationship. She asked me this question where she was like, what do the women you date normally look like I was like, well, I don't know they don't they \n\nThey can be short or tall they can have like dark hair or whatever and like I had no idea and I think that this was what that question was. Oh, yeah, duh, so it's so like, how how do you date knowing all of this? ",
        "Do you still go on and don't you don't date or you don't go on online dating sites? Well, I don't go on online dating sites and because of the way the world works now, I generally don't go one day. \n\nEven been on a date since I deleted all of my dating apps how long ago was that couple months. ",
        "It just seems too dangerous to full of skis balls and it seems \n\nLike it's too easy for for people who would use me to find me. \n\nSo when I told Phoebe about not going on any dates, she said that's not a solution. You know, here's a here's the thing those things. I know it's scary. That's why we have to be careful, but you're letting them control your future and I have you I refuse to do it. Yeah. I know. I it's hard to be bigger than my fear. It's hard it is and I think it's okay. I mean, you know, it's same thing with any kind of a heartbreak, right? \n\nYou get harder, you can't stop looking for that person and you can't stop loving someone because of that one person who hurt you. ",
        "It's been a couple months since I deleted all my dating apps and the fear has subsided since then on the internet. It was so easy for men to look at my picture and see a doe in a field of dandelions. But I choose to meet men in real life now where they will have to come out from behind their screens. They'll actually have to look into my eyes. \n\nEyes and hold out their hands and that's when they'll find out that I have teeth and they are Sharp. \n\n",

        "You have reached the every little thing helpline. Please leave your message after the tone. \n\nHello, my name is Kurt Anderson. And every time that I eat cheese, I wonder who was the first person to discover cheese because to make cheese you have to basically let milk go bad and then who decided like you know, what I'm going to eat this little lump of something and then decided that was good and I'm going to try and make more of it. \n\nHi. Hey Kurt. It's Flora Hi. How are you? I'm good. What prompted you to go down? This mental Rabbit Hole. ",
        "Well when I got married and I got a real job my wife and I started a cheese of the month club with two members myself and my wife and boy were my eyes opened. ",
        "There are. \n\nSo many Cheese's yeah, there's a whole stinky world out there. Yes Kraft singles. ",
        "That's what I thought. Jesus was and I yeah, I just kind of thought that she's just happened and I didn't think anything past that like, I didn't think how stupid that was. That's kind of how I feel every week on this show exactly. So we've been doing a different cheese every month and that got me into the question of like who was the first person to eat cheese or make cheese or discover cheese. \n\nDo you have a theory? Oh, absolutely. Here's my hypothesis. ",
        "I think it happened high up on a hillside in Switzerland high on a hill and a cow drop some milk into a field in may be its own hoof print and then I think it mixed with all the stuff in the dirt and \n\nthe grass and a baked in the Sun and then I think a farmer walked by and said mmm, that looks interesting and then ate it. \n\n",
        "Kurt I mean, I'm not the expert but I don't see how else it could happen What date would you put on this Alpine fairy tale? It would have to be somewhere in the 14 or 15 hundredths like the Renaissance. Exactly. Yes. You have your Galileo's and you have your mozzarella's. \n\nSo Kurt, we ran your question by a cheese historian and he loved it. Yeah, that is the seminal question that you have to start with. How did this all begin? ",
        "Who is the chief historian? I am Paulk instead. I'm a professor of Food Science here at the University of Vermont and Paul wrote a 225 page book cheese and culture a history of cheese and its place in western civilization. ",
        "It's a pretty compelling story that \n\nThat cheese shaped large swaths of humanity. He is very serious about cheese if he were a cheese you'd be a hard cheese. \n\n",
        "Kurt your guess is that the primordial cheese was born five hundred years ago in Switzerland. Yep, you're off by about 10,000 years. Whoa. Paul says the story of cheese begins around 8,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent Northern Iraq and Southern turkey today and histories a little bit murky because this is long before writing. ",
        "There ain't no records but we do know this cheese is basically curdled. \n\nAnd different things can do the curdling like animal rennet will do it. But so will the bacteria that are naturally in the milk. In other words where there is milk. There might be cheese. ",
        "I like that saying and apparently there was plenty of milk by 8,000 BC. You have all the big three sheep goats and cattle all being raised for milk production. But here's the curdle and the story Paul says at this time most adults were lactose intolerant. And so what were the Neolithic people doing? \n\nIn milk, when most of the population couldn't drink it there's evidence that they were feeding the milk to babies to supplement breast milk and Paul's version of the Alpine fairy tale is that at some point some milk spoiled and instead of throwing it out some adventurous eater tried occurred? Yes. That's a hypothesis did she's back then taste the same. It would have been very tart. Very sour very acidic spreadable. Think about a goat's milk chevre. Have you ever encountered? \n\nAfter that and cheese of the month club. Yes, I've had the chevre so primitive cheese probably would have tasted like that. But when do we get the Smoking Gun evidence for cheese that comes when people learn to write some of the earliest writings were about cheese when humans gain the ability to make their thoughts per minute. What did they write about cheese? This is all in clay cuneiform. \n\nTablets that have been recovered, you know from 3000 BC lots of written records and was clear from the writings that she's making was incredibly sophisticated. ",
        "I'm gonna sleep so well tonight knowing that my love of cheese is as ancient as writing. Well, I'm not sure your love of cheese is exactly like their love of cheese. ",
        "Okay. Do you want to guess what the first cheese writing was like I would I would write a recipe down. \n\nThat's very G-rated of you Kurt. Oh no. Oh, yes. Oh, no, where are we going? There's nothing new Under the Sun put it that way. Oh, no, you're gonna ruin cheese for me. \n\nSo we just emailed you a Sumerian poem about the goddess. Inanna take a look. I cannot believe we're about to have an x-rated conversation about cheese. Is that what's that? What's going to happen? I would say it's more of a reading. Okay, it says inanna song. Yeah. Hmm. Okay, here we go. \n\n",
        "Make your milk sweet and thick make your milk sweet and thick my bridegroom my shepherd. I will drink your fresh milk. \n\nWild Bull dumuzi, make your milk sweet and thick let the milk of the goat flow in my Sheepfold. What is a metaphorical Sheepfold in 3000 BC? I can guess. Oh crap. Here we go film film. I holy fill my holy churn with honey cheese. \n\n",
        "I can't get through this. I did not expect this called to go take a turn like this. I know it's surprising have it really was surprising fill my holy turn with honey cheese. That's it. That was really the Capstone for us. That's when I stopped reading that's incredible. That is you know, what that just that just confirms to me that you can't you can take you just \n\nI don't even know what to say. All right clearly from that reading cheese is more to people than a delicious appetizer. It's revered. ",
        "It's a symbol of fertility and life cheese gets tied up with religion and Sumer cheese was a common aspect of religious practice of sacrifice in the great temples in the mythology that gets written down. \n\nInstitutionalize the religious practices these deities loved cheese cheese gets imported into religions all over the world Hindu religion. Milk. Dairy cheese is life. Its sacred and Egyptian religion milk is sacred. The cow is sacred. There's even evidence of cheese being used in rituals at Stonehenge. ",
        "Maybe Stonehenge was just a cheese market. \n\nWow, so many questions. So I would love to ask why why is she so important that you would offer it to the gods or make it? Holy this is how Paul answered that protein fat minerals vitamins calories cheese is life cheese is being stacked at altars and sacrificed to the gods because it's a superfood by this time most adults can digest Dairy and people have figured out how to preserve cheese. \n\nDidn't take much. All you have to do is salt and dry it in the sun It Last Forever cheese is high nutrient high-calorie portable and storable. It was worth its weight far more than gold. You know, it was precious. Who knows what the world be like if it hadn't been for cheese. \n\nSo Kurt, that is the Deep history of cheese. Okay, well that so how did we get from ancient cheese in a jug to process cheese in a bag? There's no single your cheese potato is insatiable. But yes, but skip ahead to the cheese Frontier the processed cheese section of the dairy aisle. I want you. \n\nAble to select your next bag of cheese with confidence. \n\nYou can get really good processed cheese. That's mostly cheese. That's wide Metzger. He's a processed cheese Monger. So he works with companies to develop new cheeses like heat weeks the stringiness or the melting anise or the cheese compression strength D. Press it down and it's going to measure the force. It takes to crush the cheese. So this is simulating if you have a solid cheese and you take a bite out of that cheese and how easy it is to bite through that cheese. This is simulating my mouth. \n\nThis is exactly simulating your mouth. \n\n",
        "I cannot believe there are people who dedicate their lives to this Lloyd's argument for processed cheese is that it can do things that no natural cheese can do what other cheese can you make that nacho cheese sauce or k so from and have it melt and flow and have that creaminess that you want the and you can't get that from any natural cheese, but not all processed cheese is created equal so labels that say cheese food cheese spread cheese product have less Dairy. \n\nAnd and if you want the premium bagged Cheese look for this pasteurized process cheese pasteurized process cheese. That's like a that's Lloyd approved Lloyd approved. ",
        "It's primarily made with cheese and you can add a little bit of additional milk fat and a little bit of water and some additional salt and then what are called emulsifying salts typically sodium citrate and these emulsifying salts do an important job. ",
        "They hold \n\nHold the oil in the cheese making it creamy when you melt it interesting. I've always seen. Yeah, when you're cooking up cheese. I've seen those beads of sweat kind of come up off the top of them. I've always wondered why that's happening because there's not not emulsified salts. Yep. That's right. And so like you can actually look if you're buying Kraft singles, they come in different varieties, like there's a top-shelf single. So they'll be a deluxe single that is pasteurized process cheese. \n\n",
        "The craft Deluxe single is the creamy gold standard of processed cheese with ten thousand year old roots. That is what I'm going to think about the next time I unpeel a slice I have I feel like I am tapping into an ancient power now, I mean, I can see goddess. Inanna soaking in a bath of melted craft a luck singles fill my holy turn with honey cheese. ",
        "I'm gonna I'm gonna stencil that on my wall in my \n\nmy bedroom \n\nI'm really glad that you committed this line by line to memory. I didn't do it on purpose. You just can't get something like that out. This is going to linger. \n\nAfter the break listener Judy has a question about what happens when you have a wasp in your shorts. \n\nWe received a follow-up question about last week's episode and I think you'll enjoy it. \n\nIL T. This is Judy from San Diego. Just listen to your cicada killer podcast, and I have a question. You said the wasc will crawl up into your shorts and sting you but she didn't say what would happen when it got there. So do you end up being paralyzed and dragged off to a hidey hole to feed little baby wasps? Just curious. Thanks. \n\nJudy I'm so glad you asked because this gives us an opportunity to tell you exactly what cicada killer wasps do if they get up your pants. This happens crawls up your bare leg and you don't notice it and it crawls under the shorts. ",
        "Cicada killer biologists Chuck holiday was available for this fact check. Well, I'm very flattered at your interest particularly now that I'm retired in every day is Saturday quick refresher. ",
        "The male's can't sting you but they will try to \n\nusing their penis \n\nas for the females I have abused them in many ways. I've called over 2,000 knocked him out with CO2 glued numbers on their back. I let them recover in my hand. They just don't sting unless you hold them down. ",
        "You know, if one let's say got stuck under the elastic waistband of your shorts, then it might sting you the thing is that when they sting you it hurts but not bad. They don't have any irritating substance like wasps and \n\nPlease do that make it hurt. It's just an aesthetic and in it feels like Pain Put in you and then within a minute or two it begins to go to sleep because it does the same thing to your nervous system that it does to the cicadas. It dulls it it for me. It feels like novocaine at the dentist's office and the finger gets Buzzy or your upper thigh and then it wears off and it's as if nothing happened except there's a little red spot. ",
        "So the sting is one out of five for one is you say \n\nOuch, what was that in five is you lie down on the ground and scream for a while. ",
        "We have washed that do that but they're called tarantula Hawks personally. I feel like having being numbed a little bit. I've heard of worse things. ",
        "There you go. I mean you asked for it at the dentist's office, right? And then you the rest of the afternoon. You're numb or in my cocktail. There you go. \n\nThank you Judy for the excellent follow-up. \n\nBefore we go we're looking for your car stories for an upcoming episode. We got a message that got us thinking about car Spira sees guilty listener Lindsey called in about her brother. ",
        "He really stresses me out every time he goes to fuel up the gas tank in his car because he refuses to turn his car off and he leaves the engine running while he's pumping his gas and I'm always worried he's going to make us both explode and he is convinced that this is unnecessary and not something that he needs to do. \n\n",
        "Do you or someone you love have a car spara? See some logic-defying belief that you hold onto when it comes to your car. It could be something like Lindsey Story or maybe you have a car ritual or Superstition. Like maybe you lift your feet off the pedals when you go over a railroad crossing even though that seems very dangerous. What are the weird things that you do in your car? Call us and tell us about it eight three three ring elt a33 ring elt. And if you have a burning question \n\nin you can't answer. Give us a call. \n\n",
        "Every little thing is produced by Aaron Reese BB Flanagan, Kristen Clark Annette Heist and Flora Lichtman with help from Nicole. Bazooka and Doug Barron Ian, chill. Again Caitlin. Kenny are our Consulting editors, dhara Hirsch scored and mix this episode. I hope that wasn't too cheesy. Goodbye. \n\n"
